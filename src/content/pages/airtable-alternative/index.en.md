      title: The best Airtable alternative for your company
      text: With SeaTable, you are choosing a no-code solution that offers you maximum flexibility, the highest data protection standards and excellent value for money. Whether you are looking for a cost-effective Airtable alternative, need a self-hosted solution or work in an international team – SeaTable is the best alternative to Airtable.<br><br>SeaTable offers an on-premises option, has fewer technical restrictions and is available in more languages. With a clear focus on flexibility and data protection, SeaTable stands out from all Airtable competitors – especially if you are looking for an Airtable on-premise alternative. For companies in the EU, SeaTable is the no-code solution par excellence and the safest alternative, as Airtable cannot fully comply with the GDPR.

      subtitle: Advantages of SeaTable over Airtable
      title: Whether self-hosted or in the cloud, you will love SeaTable
      items:
          - q: 'Absolute data security'
            a: "**With SeaTable, you enjoy European data protection or even full data sovereignty**<br><br>US cloud systems such as Airtable, Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace are widely used, but the security of your data can fall by the wayside. The so-called Patriot Act allows US authorities such as the FBI, NSA or CIA to access the servers of US companies without a court order and siphon off personal data.<br><br>The SeaTable Cloud is hosted exclusively in Exoscale's German data centers. This means that your data is subject to the GDPR and is much better protected than with US providers. You can use SeaTable as an Airtable alternative for sensitive, personal data or in industries that require a higher level of data protection.<br><br>Apart from this, you can also host SeaTable yourself as an alternative to Airtable. With your own SeaTable server, you have full control over all data flows and storage locations. You only have this absolute data sovereignty with an on-premises system.<br><br>**Simple and secure login**<br><br>Just like Airtable Login, SeaTable also offers you a secure and simple login process that also supports two-factor authentication. With granular authorization management, you can ensure that only authorized users can access the data."
          - q: 'On-premises option'
            a: '**Take full control of your data with a self-hosted SeaTable system**<br><br>When installing SeaTable, you have complete freedom: you alone decide where to set up your system, where your data is stored, and who has access to it. Airtable, as a cloud-only solution, does not offer a self-hosting option.<br><br>You can run SeaTable on Linux servers as well as Windows servers, dedicated or virtualized. For larger user groups, cluster mode is also available.'
          - q: 'Free version with more features and higher limits'
            a: '**Test SeaTable thoroughly – non-binding and at no cost with SeaTable Free**<br><br>Most of SeaTable’s features are already available in the Free version of SeaTable Cloud and the Developer Edition for self-hosting. This way, you can try SeaTable as an Airtable alternative easily and for free. For [registration]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}}), all you need is an e-mail address and an internet connection.<br><br>SeaTable is also more generous than the competition when it comes to row and data limits. With SeaTable Free, you can store up to 10,000 rows and 2 GB of data.'
          - q: 'More affordable business packages'
            a: '**Get more for your money**<br><br>With a comparable range of functions, SeaTable Enterprise is considerably cheaper for your company than Airtable Team (or even Airtable Business). In addition, SeaTable Enterprise has no row limit and significantly more storage space for your files. Here you can find more information about [Airtable Pricing]({{< relref "posts/airtable" >}}).'
          - q: 'Multilingual support'
            a: '**Offer your users a web interface in their native language**<br><br>English may be the number one business language, but it still makes more sense to offer your employees a web interface in their native language.<br><br>As Airtable Alternative No. 1, SeaTable currently supports the languages German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Chinese in addition to English.'
          - q: 'Automate individual processes'
            a: '**Create your own custom automations and workflows**<br><br>No one knows your processes and requirements better than you. Simply adapt SeaTable to your needs! The no-code solution offers exactly the flexibility you need.<br><br>With SeaTable, you can automate recurring processes and tailor your system precisely to your workflows. SeaTable provides integrated features such as buttons, automations, and scripts. You can also connect external apps to SeaTable via the SeaTable API or automation platforms like Zapier, Integrately, Make, or n8n.'
          - q: 'Comprehensive and flexible API'
            a: '**Manage your entire system, users, and bases via the API**<br><br>Airtable offers API calls to retrieve and edit data within your bases. However, the Airtable API does not, for example, allow you to create a sharing link or add a new team member.<br><br>In SeaTable, you can do all this easily with the API. API requests to modify data within a base and many other API calls for regular users, team leaders, and system administrators are available. Check out our [API Reference](https://api.seatable.com).'
          - q: 'Your URL, your logo, your CI'
            a: '**Make SeaTable your very own system**<br><br>Airtable is a cloud-only solution. Customization options for the user interface are therefore limited to visual aspects like colors and logo replacement.<br><br>As an Airtable alternative, SeaTable offers much more extensive customization options: In the Dedicated Cloud and with on-premises installation, you have your own URL for you and your employees to access your SeaTable system. You choose the colors, the logo, and have full control over your corporate identity. You can also define your own templates, user roles, and permissions to reflect your individual needs and company structure.'
          - q: 'Even as a powerful CRM system'
            a: '**SeaTable is perfect as a CRM solution**<br><br>Are you managing customer data with a CRM in Airtable? An Airtable CRM is particularly questionable for companies in the EU in terms of data protection law, as Airtable naturally stores data on cloud servers in the USA.<br><br>As a GDPR-compliant European alternative to Airtable, SeaTable is suitable for implementing a CRM system for your customer data and business processes. Whether a simple CRM for a small team or a complex solution for a large company – SeaTable offers all the features you need.'

      title: Frequently asked questions about SeaTable as an Airtable alternative
      items:
          - q: 'Can I try SeaTable for free?'
            a: 'Yes, of course. The free version of SeaTable Cloud is ideal for getting a first impression of SeaTable. All you need is an email address and an internet connection. You can [register]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}}) for the free version now and switch to a paid subscription or a self-hosted system at any time.<br><br>If you want to start directly with an on-premises installation, you will find all information in our [Administrator’s Manual](https://admin.seatable.io).'

          - q: 'Who is SeaTable suitable for?'
            a: 'SeaTable does not have just <em>one</em> target group. On the contrary: we are convinced that every company and every team can benefit from SeaTable. We are always surprised by the diverse processes and workflows that are conceived and built with SeaTable. If you are looking for concrete use cases, you will find some examples in our Success Stories or on our [blog]({{< relref "posts" >}}).'

          - q: 'Can I install SeaTable wherever I want?'
            a: 'Yes, definitely. You can install SeaTable Enterprise on your local PC, a virtual machine, in the data center of your choice, or even with a cloud server provider of your choice. The only requirement is a Linux operating system with Docker and Docker Compose.'

          - q: 'How do you install your own SeaTable system?'
            a: 'Installing a SeaTable Enterprise on-premises system is not difficult and is described in the [Administrator’s Manual](https://admin.seatable.io). If you prefer to watch a video, take a look at our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/seatable).'

          - q: 'Is there business support?'
            a: 'We are always available for SeaTable Enterprise users. The most direct way is via our [contact form]({{< relref "pages/contact" >}}). You can find more information about possible support options on our [Support]({{< relref "pages/support" >}}) page.'

          - q: 'Can SeaTable be adapted to my own corporate identity?'
            a: 'In the SeaTable Cloud, customization options for your CI—just like with Airtable—are limited. With SeaTable Cloud Enterprise, you can adjust both the logo and colors, but the URL will always remain https://cloud.seatable.io.<br><br>It’s a completely different story with a Dedicated or On-Premises system. As a self-hosted Airtable alternative, SeaTable can be customized as you wish. You define the URL, set up templates, roles, and permissions available to users, and of course, you can change the logo and colors. You only have this freedom with your own on-premises installation, which Airtable cannot offer.'

          - q: 'Where can I find more information about the API interface?'
            a: 'To get the most out of SeaTable, you should take a look at the REST [API Reference for SeaTable](https://api.seatable.com). As an Airtable alternative, SeaTable shines with comparatively many API calls that Airtable does not provide.'

          - q: 'What is the difference between the Free and Enterprise subscription?'
            a: 'Basically, we strive to make SeaTable available to everyone for free. That’s why there is both a free cloud version and a freely available Developer Edition for self-installation. However, if you are seriously considering SeaTable as an Airtable alternative and want to use it intensively (e.g., in your company), we recommend switching to the paid Enterprise subscription of SeaTable Cloud or using SeaTable Enterprise on your own server.<br><br>With the Enterprise subscription in the cloud, you get additional features such as advanced sharing and automations, and your row and storage limits are increased. Details can be found in the [pricing overview]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).<br><br>On-premises, we generally recommend using SeaTable Enterprise. With up to three users, the SeaTable Server license is free! There are also affordable starter packages for small teams. SeaTable Enterprise includes all SeaTable features—including support for cluster-capable backend systems like CEPH, authentication systems like Active Directory, SAML, and OAuth, and many other relevant features that make life easier for administrators. The Developer Edition has the feature set of the Free version.'

          - q: 'Are there special conditions or discounts for public institutions such as universities, associations, or non-profit organizations?'
            a: 'Definitely. [Contact us]({{< relref "pages/contact" >}}) and we will be happy to tell you more about our extensive discounts.'

          - q: 'Can you switch between SeaTable Cloud and On-Premises?'
            a: 'Migration between SeaTable Cloud and your own on-premises solution is very easy thanks to powerful export and import functions.'

          - q: 'Where does SeaTable store its data? Where are the servers located?'
            a: 'With your own self-hosted system, only you decide where your data is stored.<br><br>The servers of our SeaTable Cloud are located 100% in Germany. Thus, your data is subject to the GDPR and European data protection regulations.'

          - q: 'Where can I get help developing my own plugin?'
            a: 'The idea is that anyone with some programming experience can write and develop their own SeaTable plugins. However, if you wish, we can also handle this development for you. [Write to us]({{< relref "pages/contact" >}}) and let’s talk about your idea.'

          - q: 'What about security? Do you have full data sovereignty with SeaTable?'
            a: 'Absolutely. With your own SeaTable on-premises system, you decide where the data is stored. But even with our cloud, we apply the highest security standards of all Airtable alternatives. Your data is stored in a German data center, making it subject to the GDPR and European data protection regulations.'

          - q: 'Is SeaTable GDPR compliant?'
            a: 'Yes, with SeaTable you can comply with the GDPR both in the cloud and on-premises. Basically, compliance with the GDPR is much easier if you run your own on-premises system.<br><br>If your data, on the other hand, is stored with US cloud providers such as Airtable, Microsoft 365, or Google Workspace, US authorities can access this data according to the so-called Patriot Act. Therefore, the use of these systems can hardly be reconciled with European data protection laws. If you are looking for an Airtable alternative, SeaTable is a safe choice.<br><br>Note: This FAQ entry refers to German law. Other countries may have different legal requirements.'

          - q: 'What is the difference between SeaTable Cloud and SeaTable On-Premises?'
            a: 'SeaTable Cloud is a software-as-a-service from SeaTable GmbH. We manage and administer the SeaTable system, which you can access at https://cloud.seatable.io, and you commission us as your service provider to store your data.<br><br>With SeaTable On-Premises, you are the administrator of your server. We only provide you with the installation files and the SeaTable Enterprise license key, and you can install and manage the system yourself. Only with an on-premises system do you have full data sovereignty.'

          - q: 'Can someone handle the installation for me?'
            a: 'We are happy to handle the installation of your local SeaTable system. [Write to us]({{< relref "pages/contact" >}}) and we will be happy to make you an offer.'
