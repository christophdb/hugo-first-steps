      title: FAQ - SeaTable as an Asana alternative
      items:
          - q: 'Who is SeaTable suitable for?'
            a: 'SeaTable is particularly attractive for users who are looking for a powerful, flexible, versatile and affordable process management tool while staying below the cost of Asana. Through automation and customizable structures and workflows, companies can make their processes faster and more transparent and work collaboratively in real time. With SeaTable as a process management tool, you can map everything in one platform and easily integrate other tools, such as an email client, without any additional programming effort. This makes SeaTable the first choice among the alternatives to Asana.'
          - q: 'Is SeaTable suitable for teams of any size?'
            a: 'Absolutely, SeaTable is completely customizable and scalable. You can use our platform for a wide range of tasks and processes: from simple checklists and project management to complete CRM systems. This makes SeaTable the ideal alternative to the Asana tool to avoid Asana software costs and use an alternative Asana for free.'
          - q: 'Does SeaTable offer a free version?'
            a: 'Like Asana, SeaTable can be used free of charge. For small teams of up to 25 people, we offer a cloud-based free version that already has all the features and necessary functions and views - ideal as an Asana freeware alternative. With automations, Universal App Builder, numerous free templates and integrated forms, SeaTable Free offers a package that no Asana alternative offers for free. And if the free version is no longer sufficient, you can easily change your subscription. You can switch to a higher subscription level at any time and, as with the Asana notice period, cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period.'
          - q: 'Is SeaTable available in multiple languages?'
            a: "For companies with multilingual or internationally operating teams, multilingual tools are particularly important. SeaTable is available as an Asana alternative in German, English, French and other languages. For optimal user-friendliness, the user interface is always displayed in the user's preferred language. This means that the platform can easily be used as an Asana alternative in German or internationally."
          - q: 'How easy is it to switch from Asana to SeaTable?'
            a: 'Thanks to our powerful API, via an automation platform or using CSV import, migrating data from the Asana project management software to SeaTable is very easy - just as easy or easier than with other alternatives to Asana.'
          - q: 'Does SeaTable offer free support?'
            a: 'Our support team is available to answer any questions you may have about SeaTable. You can either ask your questions in the forum or write an e-mail directly. As a German alternative to Asana, SeaTable offers a support package that no Asana alternatives offer.'
          - q: 'Does SeaTable also offer a Kanban view?'
            a: 'Yes, like the project management tool Asana, SeaTable offers   Kanban boards and other project views. If you are used to working with Asana, you will easily find your way around SeaTable and realize that a SeaTable view is not fundamentally different from an Asana board. All views are available to you regardless of the selected subscription. If you have been using Asana for your project management up to now, you can use SeaTable free of charge as a replacement for the Asana software. Without any restrictions in the presentation of your processes, SeaTable is the ideal alternative to the Asana project management tool, or to do resource planning in the same way as in Asana.'
