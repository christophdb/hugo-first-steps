      title: Start with a Base
      description: |
          A base in SeaTable organizes all information about a topic, task, or process. <br><br>You can use a base, for example, for:
      items:
          - text: Plan a project
          - text: Recruit new employees
          - text: Monitor a marketing campaign
          - text: Manage licenses in your company

      title: Structure your first table
      description: |
          When you open a base, you’ll see one or more tables. Before you can enter data, you need to add more table columns.<br><br>
          A project plan, for example, needs the following columns:
      items:
          - text: Single select for status
          - text: Date for the due date
          - text: Employee for the person responsible
