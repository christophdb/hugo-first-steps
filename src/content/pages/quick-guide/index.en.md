      title: Start with a Base
      description: |
          A base in SeaTable organizes all information about a topic, task, or process. <br><br>You can use a base, for example, for:
      items:
          - text: Plan a project
          - text: Recruit new employees
          - text: Monitor a marketing campaign
          - text: Manage licenses in your company

      title: Structure your first table
      description: |
          When you open a base, you’ll see one or more tables. Before you can enter data, you need to add more table columns.<br><br>
          A project plan, for example, needs the following columns:
      items:
          - text: Single select for status
          - text: Date for the due date
          - text: Employee for the person responsible

      title: Enter your first data into your table
      description: |
          Projects consist of many small steps. Add all the tasks that come to mind. <br><br>
          Tasks that are successfully completed are usually:
      items:
          - text: Clearly described
          - text: Provided with a deadline
          - text: Assigned to a responsible person

      title: Activate a plugin
      description: |
          In many situations, a different form of presentation can be helpful. For example, activate the Kanban plugin.<br><br>

      items:
          - text: Calendar

          - text: Expiration date
