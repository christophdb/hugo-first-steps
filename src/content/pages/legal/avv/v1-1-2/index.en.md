These are the Data Processing Agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR of **SeaTable GmbH, 117er Ehrenhof 5, 55118 Mainz**.

## 1. Subject Matter of the Agreement

### 1.1 Subject Matter of the Data Processing Agreement

The subject matter of this agreement is the provision of the online database service SeaTable (online service) for one or more users managed by the controller and the provision of related services. Under this agreement, depending on the subscribed plan or chosen deployment option, the controller may use a browser and the service’s API to process data (to collect, store, modify, share, and delete it).

### 1.2

The subject of the agreement is not the processor’s own use or processing of personal data. However, in the course of providing the online service and fulfilling obligations regarding support, maintenance, data backup, and administration, access to personal data cannot be entirely excluded.

### 1.3

Details are specified in the agreement summarized under the customer number mentioned above. This Data Processing Agreement applies to the entire contractual relationship, insofar as the services described in section 1.1 are concerned.

### 1.4

Whenever “data” is referred to below, this exclusively means personal data within the meaning of the GDPR. The following data protection and data security provisions apply to all data processing services within the meaning of Art. 28(1) GDPR performed by the processor for the controller and to all activities where employees or subcontractors of the processor may come into contact with the controller’s personal data.

### 1.5

In addition to the contract concluded between the parties, this Data Processing Agreement specifies the mutual obligations for handling the controller’s data.

## 2. Term, Termination, Deletion of Data

### 2.1

The term of this agreement depends on the duration of IT support services provided by the processor on behalf of the controller. The agreement ends when the controller no longer makes use of the processor’s services in accordance with the relevant service agreements or offers.

### 2.2

Data subjects whose data are processed by the processor must assert their rights, in particular to rectification, deletion, and blocking, against the controller. The controller alone is responsible for safeguarding these rights.

### 2.3

After termination of the agreement or upon written request by the controller, the processor must delete all of the controller’s data in full, in compliance with data protection requirements, within a reasonable period (including backup or security copies) or return it to the controller. The same applies to test or discarded material, which must be securely stored until deletion or return. This does not apply to documentation required as evidence of proper data processing or where legal or regulatory obligations prevent deletion. Any additional costs incurred by premature deletion before contract termination are borne by the controller.

### 2.4

The processor must promptly forward to the controller any data subject requests received directly, without processing them independently, unless agreed otherwise with the controller.

### 2.5

The processor must assist the controller, within technical and practical means, in fulfilling data subjects’ rights under Chapter III of the GDPR—particularly for rectification, blocking, deletion, notification, and information requests.

### 2.6

There is no physical data carrier exchange pursuant to Art. 28(3)(g) GDPR between the parties to this Data Processing Agreement; therefore, no return needs to be regulated.

### 3.1

### 3.2

Any collection, processing, and/or use of data by the processor takes place exclusively within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, a Member State of the European Union, or a Contracting State of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
