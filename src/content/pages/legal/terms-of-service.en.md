## General

SeaTable GmbH (“we” or “us”) provides the cloud service SeaTable Cloud, the store SeaTable Market as well as other online products and services (collectively “SeaTable”). By using SeaTable, you agree to these Terms and the use of your personal information as explained in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use SeaTable.

If you use SeaTable on behalf of organization (i.e., a public entity or an enterprise), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization, and warrant that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on the organization’s behalf. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to this organization.

The Terms may be updated by us without prior notice. The current version of the Terms is always available at https://seatable.io/terms-of-service/. We recommend you come back to this site regularly to review the Terms. We will inform you about material changes of the Terms at our own discretion by e-mail or notification. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, discontinue using SeaTable immediately. By continuing to use SeaTable without objection for more than 6 weeks after receipt of the updated Terms, you agree to the updated Terms. The right of both parties to terminate without notice for good cause remains unaffected.

## Operation and Hosting

SeaTable, whose access and use is governed in these Terms, is operated by SeaTable GmbH that has its registered office in Mainz, Germany (address: SeaTable GmbH, 117er Ehrenhof 5, 55118 Mainz, Germany).

The developer of the Software, which provides the SeaTable service and the SeaTable Plugin Market is Seafile Ltd. that has its registered off in Beijing, China (address: Seafile Ltd., GuiGuLiangCheng, Block 2B, #310, HaiDian District, Beijing, China). Part of the software are released under an open-source license.

The cloud service SeaTable Cloud and the store SeaTable Market are hosted at Exoscale in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. We rely on the resources of the developer and other partners to maintain the software and the services. This also applies to dedicated SeaTable systems. We concluded data processing agreements with Exoscale, Seafile Ltd. and our other partners which are available upon request.

SeaTable is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. These Terms do not transfer to you any right, ownership or interest in intellectual property.

## Registration

Using SeaTable requires registration. (An unregistered person can only obtain read-only access to data shared by a registered user.) Registration is generally done through the website at https://seatable.io.

When registering, you must enter the required registration information. This includes first and last name, e-mail address and a password.

To confirm your registration, you will receive an e-mail to the e-mail address entered during registration. This mail contains a link. By clicking this link, you complete the registration.

Upon completion of the registration, a team will be assigned to your user account. As the only member of the team at this time, you are the team administrator and can add additional team members. You can also appoint additional team administrators from the team members.

A user account is created for each additional team member. This user account is permanently assigned to the team. It is not possible to transfer a user account to another team.

Corporate customers can also register via an order form. Please contact the sales team at sales@seatable.io.

## User Accounts

Access to user accounts is protected by at least one factor (e.g. user password). Optionally, another factor can be activated. We recommend activating 2-factor authentication to improve user accounts’ protection against unauthorized access.

You are responsible for safeguarding your SeaTable login credentials. Make sure that your credentials – accidently or by error – do not fall into the wrong hands. Do not disclose or share your credentials with any other person. If you suspect that one or more other unauthorized persons have access to your user account, change your credentials immediately.

As team administrator you must inform and instruct each team member about password secrecy.

You are responsible for all activity on your user account or actions carried out by your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You must immediately notify us by e-mail to abuse@seatable.io of any unauthorized use of your account.

## Subscriptions

SeaTable is offered on a subscription basis. The available services and resources depend on the selected subscription.

With the registration, you conclude a free subscription with us. With a free subscription, you can test and evaluate SeaTable and use it for personal and commercial purposes only restricted by the functional and technical limits of the free account.

For productive use, we recommend our paid subscription with an extended feature set and resources. We accept credit cards such as VISA and MasterCard as means of payment for Paid Subscriptions.

A comparison of the available subscriptions and their costs can be found at https://seatable.io/en/preise.

The subscription period is the agreed contractual term of the subscription. For free subscriptions, the subscription period is always one month. For paid subscriptions, monthly and an annual subscription periods are available. You can check the end of the current subscription period in account management.

You can switch to a subscription with a more features and resources (“upgrade”) at any time via account management. When upgrading for the first time or if the payment method on file is invalid, you will be asked to update your payment information. An upgrade is carried out with immediate effect. The costs for the upgrade are due immediately for the agreed subscription period and will be debited to your payment method. An existing paid subscription will be partially credited.

You can switch to a subscription with less features and resources including a switch to a free subscription (“downgrade”) at any time via account management. The downgrade will be carried out at the end of the current subscription period. A downgrade with immediate effect is not possible. We do not refund – in full or pro-rata.

Subscriptions renew automatically unless the subscription has been cancelled via account management. The renewal period is the expired subscription period. The costs for the renewal are due on the first day of renewal and are debited to your payment method.

In case of non-payment or failure of the payment process, your and your team members’ access to the data in SeaTable is set to read-only. Read-only access means that you can view, export and delete you bases (and your data). Yet, it is not possible to edit the data in your bases. In case of long payment arrears and after repeated requests for payment including setting a deadline, we can terminate your subscription and delete your data.

When reaching the resources granted under your subscription, you receive a message and access to your user account and that of all team members is set to read-only.

A subscription can be terminated at any time without notice to the end of the current subscription period. This applies to both free and paid subscriptions. A subscription can be terminated by a team administrator via the account management.

Upon termination, all user accounts assigned to the team are deactivated and marked for deletion. After a few days, the user accounts are deleted from the system. The data associated with the user accounts will then be removed from the storage infrastructure as part of a regular, automated cleaning process (“garbage cleaning”). Once the termination takes effect at the end of the subscription period, it is generally not possible to restore data. In justified exceptional cases, a restore can be attempted for a fee.

We reserve the right to unilaterally terminate your access or restrict your access at any time without prior notice to you. Sufficient reasons are gross violations of these Terms, the disruption of access by other users or legal liability.

## Use of Services

You may only use SeaTable as permitted by law, including all applicable federal, state, local or international law or regulation. We may investigate violations of these Terms. We cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute violators.

In particular, you may not

- Store copyright/trademark/patent protected material for which no corresponding rights of use exist, as well as its processing, publication, making accessible, editing and redesign
- Store prohibited content (e.g. messages of hate and violence, child and youth pornography) as well as their processing, publication, making accessible, editing and redesign
- Store malware and potentially unwanted programs (“PUPs”) and their distribution
- Send spam or other unwanted communications/advertising messages
- Use SeaTable to attack SeaTable itself or other systems
- Register team members against their will
- Misrepresent your own person/organization (e.g. by using e-mail addresses to which you do not have access)
- Invade privacy of third parties

We will inform you about important events and changes to the services (“system messages”) by means of system notifications, the website https://seatable.io and/or e-mail (e.g. planned maintenance work, system updates and security incidents). We will inform you about critical events and changes by e-mail. The messages will be sent to the e-mail address linked to your user account. It is not possible to unsubscribe from system messages.

## Your Content

You retain full ownership of the content you upload to SeaTable. We do not acquire any ownership or rights of use, except for the limited rights necessary to offer SeaTable.

You are solely responsible for your content and indicate that you own or have the necessary rights to all of your content, and that use of your content does not infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

You can remove your content by deleting it. Deleted content is no longer displayed, but it is still saved in the logs and snapshots created by SeaTable. (SeaTable’s logs and snapshots are used to undo unwanted changes. The period for which SeaTable saves the logs and snapshots depends on the selected subscription). Consequently, in order to permanently delete content, you must delete all relevant logs and snapshots. The content is then permanently removed from the storage infrastructure during system cleanup cycles. It is impossible to restore content after the cleanup cycles.

We are not responsible or can be held liable for the deletion of any of your content.

Under certain circumstances, some of your content may not be completely removed (e.g., when you added/modified data in tables/bases shared by another user).

We are not responsible or liable for the failure to remove or delete content in these situations.

## Publicity

We reserve the right to use the name, logo and marks of corporate customers on the seatable.io website and other marketing materials as reference customers.

## Limitation of Liability

Liability for negligent breaches of duty is excluded, unless these concern guarantees or essential contractual obligations, i.e. obligations whose fulfillment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on breach jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the contract and which the customer regularly trusts in their compliance; it does not concern damages from injury to life, body or health. Claims under the Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected.

In the event of a breach of material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on the observance of which the contractual partner may regularly rely, (cardinal obligations) due to negligence on our part, on the part of our legal representatives or vicarious agents, liability shall be limited in amount to the damage typically foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract, the occurrence of which must typically be expected.

Otherwise, claims for damages are excluded.

The same applies to breaches of duty by our legal representatives or our vicarious agents.

Given the current state of technology, data communication via the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be error-free and/or available at all times. We are not liable for the continuous or uninterrupted availability of SeaTable.

The user has to carry out backups and other security measures of his files independently at least every 24 hours.

The above-mentioned regulations regarding liability do not apply if mandatory country-specific law contradicts the above regulations. If this is the case, the applicable laws of the respective country shall apply.

## Applicable Law

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding rules relating to conflict of laws. The UN Sales Convention does not apply.

If the customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a public investment fund, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms is our registered office. Place of performance is our registered office.

Insofar as mandatory legal regulations and laws of the respective country conflict with these provisions, these laws take precedence over this paragraph.
