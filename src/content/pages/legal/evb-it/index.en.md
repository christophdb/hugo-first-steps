## What is EVB-IT?

The **Supplementary Contractual Terms and Conditions for the Procurement of IT Services (EVB-IT)** are the established standard for public IT procurement in Germany. They ensure legal certainty, transparency, and efficient contracting processes between public contracting authorities and IT service providers.

SeaTable fully complies with the requirements of this contract type and offers public sector clients a powerful, globally proven, self-hosted no-code solution – flexible, secure, and fully operable under your own control.
