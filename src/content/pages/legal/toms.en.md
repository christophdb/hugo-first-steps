These are the Technical and Organizational Measures pursuant to Art. 32 GDPR of **SeaTable GmbH, 117er Ehrenhof 5, 55118 Mainz**.

## Preamble

Taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the processor has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to ensure a level of protection for the controller's personal data appropriate to the risk.

This documentation contains the TOMs implemented by the processor. The presentation of the TOMs follows the measures explicitly named in Art. 32(1) GDPR. These apply generally or specifically to the data processing systems rented from Akenes SA (Exoscale), on which the offered online service is operated, where explicitly mentioned.
