          - q: Who can open support tickets?
            a: Support tickets are available to you with SeaTable Enterprise or SeaTable Dedicated. Free and Plus customers can always seek help in the Community Forum.
          - q: Can I test the Enterprise features?
            a: We can upgrade your Free or Plus subscription to an Enterprise subscription for a limited time free of charge. Please send us a request via team management.
          - q: Can I change the number of users in my team?
            a: 'Yes, you can adjust the users in your team at any time. With SeaTable Cloud Free, Plus, and Enterprise, you can do this yourself via team management. For SeaTable Dedicated, please contact your personal representative.<br/><br/>The team size in the Free subscription is limited to 25. For other SeaTable Cloud subscriptions and SeaTable Dedicated, the number of users is unlimited.'
          - q: Can I combine different subscriptions?
            a: This is not possible. A SeaTable subscription always applies to an entire team, i.e., all members. If you want to use the additional features and higher limits of the Plus or Enterprise subscription, you need to purchase a corresponding license for all active team members.
