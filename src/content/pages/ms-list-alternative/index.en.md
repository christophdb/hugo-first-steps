            text: Don't let Microsoft Lists restrict you to manual data entry and Excel import.<br><br>Microsoft Lists offers fewer data entry functions than SeaTable.

          - headline: Complete and flexible API
            text: Manage your entire system, users, and bases with the API.<br><br>Microsoft Lists does not offer an API interface, making it difficult to integrate Microsoft Lists with your own solutions.<br><br>The SeaTable API makes this very easy. You have access to all API functions for modifying data within a base, and many other API calls are available for regular users, team leaders, and system administrators. Check out our [API Reference](https://api.seatable.io).

          - headline: Absolute data security and EU GDPR
            text: Only with SeaTable do you have full control and determine where your data is stored.<br><br>Microsoft is an American company and stores its data in American data centers. If that’s not a problem for you, we congratulate you. But if you want full control over data flows and storage locations, you should use your own SeaTable server. This way, you can also use SeaTable for sensitive, personal data or in areas where increased protection is required. Only an on-premise system can do that.
