      items:
          - q: 'What sets SeaTable apart from other financial planning tools?'
            a: Our "Create Financial Planning" tool is characterized by easy implementation without additional IT effort, seamless integration into your existing systems, absolute GDPR compliance and individual customization options. You can combine reporting, analysis, your [profitability forecast]({{< relref "posts/rentabilitaetsvorschau" >}}), your [liquidity planning]({{< relref "posts/20250628_liquiditaetsplanung" >}}) or your capital requirements and financing plan in a single source of truth. Real-time collaboration in SeaTable helps finance teams work more efficiently and flexibly and plan more accurately. Also suitable for a financial plan in a startup.
          - q: 'Which companies is SeaTable suitable for?'
            a: 'Whether you want to create a financial plan for companies, a financial plan for small businesses or a financial plan for a startup: SeaTable is a suitable tool for companies of any size and complexity. Our pricing models are flexible and scalable, so you only pay for the features you actually need. This makes SeaTable the ideal tool for creating your financial plan online.'
          - q: How does SeaTable support real-time collaboration?
            a: SeaTable allows your entire team to work together seamlessly. You can set deadlines, assign tasks, automate workflows and control approval processes, making it easy to create your financial plan online. Automatic notifications allow everyone involved to keep track of deadlines and changes. This is just as helpful for a financial plan in a startup as it is in a large company.
          - q: Can SeaTable also be used to create an investment plan, for example?
            a: 'You can map all your finance processes in SeaTable without compromising your requirements. You can create an investment plan in SeaTable just as flexibly and collaboratively as you create financial plans or map your invoice management.'
          - q: 'How secure is sensitive financial and company data with SeaTable?'
            a: 'The protection of your data is our top priority. SeaTable Cloud is hosted exclusively on servers of a Swiss provider in Germany and is therefore fully GDPR compliant. When you create a financing plan with SeaTable, your data is safe.'
          - q: 'Can SeaTable be linked to other systems in the company?'
            a: 'Yes, SeaTable integrates easily with other accounting or payment service provider systems - either via the SeaTable API or automation tools. So you always have the choice: you can create your capital requirements and financing plan or an investment plan in SeaTable and link it to other tools, or use SeaTable for other use cases and processes.'
          - q: 'How long does it take to create a financial plan with SeaTable and is there a financial plan template?'
            a: "It only takes a few minutes to set up your SeaTable account - and that completes the implementation and you're ready to go. Thanks to the intuitive and user-friendly interface and various finance templates, you will be able to quickly create your first financial plan. If you are already using a financial plan template for Excel, you can simply import it. However, how much time you actually have to invest if you want to create a financial plan depends on various individual factors, so we cannot make a general statement on this."
          - q: 'Can SeaTable also be used free of charge?'
            a: 'Create a financial plan free of charge: If you want to set up a financial plan, SeaTable Free already offers all the functions you need. Depending on the complexity or data volume, however, we recommend taking out a Plus or Enterprise subscription. You will need the latter if you want to create a financing plan or draw up a financial plan and use the automation functions in SeaTable. If you create your financial plan online and your existing SeaTable subscription is no longer sufficient, you can easily change your subscription model at any time.'
