          - q: "Why SeaTable is the better choice compared to Personio and HeavenHR?"

HeavenHR scores with a clearly structured onboarding process and efficient working time recording. However, both platforms have limitations when it comes to customisation and integration into existing systems.
            
            SeaTable goes further here and offers complete customisability so that you can individually design and optimise HR processes such as onboarding and offboarding processes, operational HR work and travel expense reports. With its flexible API and numerous integration options, SeaTable can be seamlessly integrated into your existing workflows and also offers digital personnel file software that is secure and efficient.
