      title: FAQ – Project management with SeaTable
      items:
          - q: What projects can I use SeaTable for?
            a: You can use SeaTable for all your projects, such as software projects, [construction projects]({{< relref "posts/bauzeitenplan" >}}), or product development. Thanks to its flexible column types and diverse visualization options, SeaTable is the perfect solution for any challenge a project manager faces and offers all the features you've come to expect from agile project management tools.
          - q: Can I share my project plan with external parties?
            a: Absolutely. Many project teams collaborate with external stakeholders either via a project management app or directly in SeaTable. In both cases, you use sharing and permissions to determine who can access which content.
          - q: Which subscription do I need for efficient project management?
            a: That depends on your requirements. With the free subscription, you already get the most important features for smaller teams that other project management tools don't offer. With the Plus subscription, collaboration with external stakeholders becomes much easier thanks to the advanced sharing options, and the higher storage limits allow you to manage even large-scale projects. Finally, the Enterprise subscription adds automations, advanced customization, and big data storage for data-intensive projects. 
          - q: How can I migrate my data to SeaTable?
            a: SeaTable offers numerous import options that make it easy to migrate your data and switch from your previous project management tools. Upload your existing data and your new project management system will be up and running in no time. Thanks to the intuitive, graphical user interface, you'll quickly find your way around.
          - q: Is SeaTable an alternative to Monday, Jira, or Asana?
            a: Yes, absolutely. Many teams use these project management tools because they are well known. However, each one has specific weaknesses that you don't have with SeaTable due to its great flexibility. In addition, Asana, Monday, and Jira do not offer free versions, except for versions with severely limited functionality. Unlike SeaTable, you therefore have to accept high costs, especially for larger teams. SeaTable, on the other hand, can be used free of charge as a fully-fledged project management software. Another advantage is that SeaTable can also be used self-hosted, for example as an alternative to Jira." 
          - q: Can I also use SeaTable to map out my project planning?
            a: Yes, absolutely. SeaTable is suitable as a project planning tool for teams of all sizes. You can plan all steps of your project individually with greater flexibility than with conventional project management tools. Thanks to its numerous features, SeaTable can be used to implement a wide variety of project management methods, such as [Kanban]({{< relref "posts/kanban-methoden" >}}), a [project structure plan]({{< relref "posts/20250317-projektstrukturplan" >}}), or even Scrum.
