      title: FAQ – Project management with SeaTable
      items:
          - q: For which projects can I use SeaTable?
            a: You can use SeaTable for all your projects, e.g. software projects, construction projects or product developments. Thanks to the flexible column types and the diverse visualization options, SeaTable is the perfect solution for every challenge that a project manager has to face.
          - q: Can I share my project plan with external parties?
            a: Absolutely. Many project teams work with external stakeholders either via a project management App or directly in SeaTable together. In both cases you use shares and permissions to determine who can access which content.
          - q: Which subscription do I need for efficient project management?
            a: With the Free subscription you already get the most important functions for smaller projects and teams. With the Plus subscription the collaboration with external stakeholders becomes much easier thanks to the extended sharing options and the higher storage limits allow you to manage larger projects. In the Enterprise subscription finally automations, extended customizing and the Big-Data storage for data-intensive projects are added.
          - q: How can I migrate my data to SeaTable?
            a: "SeaTable offers numerous import options, which make the migration of your data and the switch from your previous project management Tools easy. Upload your existing data and within shortest time your new project management system is ready for use. Thanks to the intuitive, graphical user interface you will quickly find your way around."
          - q: "Is SeaTable an alternative to Monday, Jira or Asana?"
            a: "Asana, Monday and Jira are three well-known project management tools that many teams around the world use. If you're wondering whether these project management tools are free, the answer is no - apart from very limited versions. In contrast to SeaTable, you have to accept high costs, especially for larger teams, as double-digit amounts are incurred per user and month. If you want to run project management with Monday, Jira or Asana, it can get really expensive. SeaTable, on the other hand, is a convincing free project management tool for teams of any size thanks to its extensive free subscription.
            In addition, the classic project management tools are less intuitive than SeaTable. This is especially true for free project management tools. The wealth of functions can be overwhelming for beginners, especially if you want to map your project management in Monday. Jira is particularly specialised in software projects and agile projectmanagement according to Scrum, which already requires a lot of knowledge. The fact that most project participants first have to acquire this knowledge means that familiarisation takes a relatively long time, whereas you can get started straight away with SeaTable. Asana and Jira are also less flexible than SeaTable and are not recommended for data-intensive projects. Read more about this in our [blog]({{< relref \"posts\" >}})."
