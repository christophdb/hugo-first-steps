      title: FAQ – Project management with SeaTable
      items:
          - q: For which projects can I use SeaTable?
            a: You can use SeaTable for all your projects, e.g. software projects, construction projects or product developments. Thanks to the flexible column types and the diverse visualization options, SeaTable is the perfect solution for every challenge that a project manager has to face.
          - q: Can I share my project plan with external parties?
            a: Absolutely. Many project teams work with external stakeholders either via a project management App or directly in SeaTable together. In both cases you use shares and permissions to determine who can access which content.
          - q: Which subscription do I need for efficient project management?
            a: With the Free subscription you already get the most important functions for smaller projects and teams. With the Plus subscription the collaboration with external stakeholders becomes much easier thanks to the extended sharing options and the higher storage limits allow you to manage larger projects. In the Enterprise subscription finally automations, extended customizing and the Big-Data storage for data-intensive projects are added.
          - q: How can I migrate my data to SeaTable?
            a: SeaTable offers numerous import options, which make the migration of your data and the switch from your previous project management Tools easy. Upload your existing data and within shortest time your new project management system is ready for use. Thanks to the intuitive, graphical user interface you will quickly find your way around.
          - q: Is SeaTable an alternative to Monday, Jira or Asana?
            a: Asana, Monday, and Jira are three well-known project management tools used by many teams around the world. If you are wondering whether these project management tools are free, the answer is no, except for versions with severely limited functionality. Unlike SeaTable, you will have to accept high costs, especially for larger teams, as the price per user per month is in the double digits. If you want to use Monday, Jira, or [Asana Project Management]({{< relref "pages/asana-alternative" >}}), it can get really expensive. SeaTable, on the other hand, offers a comprehensive free subscription, making it the ideal free project management tool for teams of all sizes. <br>In addition, traditional project management tools are less intuitive than SeaTable. This is especially true for free project management tools. The wealth of features can be overwhelming for beginners, especially if you want to map your project management in Monday. Jira specializes in software projects and agile project management according to Scrum, which already requires a lot of knowledge. Since most project participants first have to acquire this knowledge, training takes a relatively long time, whereas with SeaTable, you can get started right away. Compared to SeaTable, Asana and Jira are also less flexible and not recommended for data-intensive projects. Read more about this in our [blog]({{< relref "posts" >}}).
