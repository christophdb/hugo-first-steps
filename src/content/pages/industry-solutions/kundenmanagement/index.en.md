      - title: SeaTable is the CRM alternative to Hubspot 
        subtitle: Flexible, Intuitive, Versatile
        text: Hubspot is a powerful but complex tool with many features that smaller teams don't necessarily need—and it's also relatively expensive. In a direct comparison, SeaTable scores as a Hubspot alternative thanks to its **enormous flexibility, higher data security, and cheaper subscription tiers**. While Hubspot has predefined structures, SeaTable can be set up like a database – **without IT support** thanks to no-code.
      - title: The Salesforce alternative for your CRM
        subtitle: Intuitive, Secure, Customizable
        text: Salesforce requires complex implementations and can only be used with extensive, expensive licensing models. SeaTable offers **simple implementation without IT effort**, maximum flexibility, and **greater data protection**—even when using SeaTable AI. In addition, SeaTable is significantly more user-friendly and **can be used as a no-code database for a wide variety of tasks.

      title: FAQ – Customer management with SeaTable
      items:
          - q: What is customer management?
            a: This term encompasses all measures that serve to establish, maintain, and preserve long-term customer relationships. The goal is to increase customer satisfaction and thus customer lifecycle value.
          - q: Why is efficient customer management important?
            a: Good customer management is the key to long-term customer loyalty. However, many companies struggle with confusing [Excel lists]({{< relref "pages/excel-alternative" >}}), complicated CRM software, or scattered customer data. Traditional CRM systems restrict you with rigid structures that make it difficult to design your processes efficiently. This leads to unnecessarily time-consuming customer management tasks and frustration among employees, and impairs communication with your customers – customer satisfaction suffers. In addition, high license costs and the need to bring in external IT resources often cause unnecessary expenses.
          - q: 'Who is SeaTable suitable for as customer management software?'
            a: SeaTable is suitable for companies of all sizes – **from start-ups to large corporations**. The tool adapts to your requirements and thus offers the right solution for every industry and every team to organize customer management tasks and improve customer management organization. With its user-friendly interface, versatile features, and new AI capabilities for analysis, classification, and automation, SeaTable helps you streamline your processes, make your daily work noticeably easier, and strengthen customer loyalty.
          - q: 'What are the disadvantages of conventional CRM systems?'
            a: "When you use traditional CRM software to map your specific business processes, you quickly encounter a number of challenges. Such systems are often only partially compatible with your company's customer management organization and cannot be adapted flexibly. Implementation is often complex, time-consuming, and requires external consultants. License and usage fees can quickly exceed your budget if you move up to the next payment tier as your needs increase. Many CRM systems are also difficult to connect to other tools already in use within the company, making holistic customer contact management difficult."
          - q: Does SeaTable offer a free version?
            a: 'For **small teams of up to 25 people**, SeaTable offers a cloud-based free version that already has all the features and necessary functions and views you need for strategic customer management. With automations, [App Builder]({{< relref "posts/20250318-app-erstellen" >}}), numerous free templates, integrated forms, and initial AI functions for evaluations, SeaTable Free offers a package that no other CRM software offers for free.'
          - q: 'Do I also get free support with SeaTable?'
            a: Yes, our support team is available to assist you with any questions or difficulties you may have. You can either contact the SeaTable community in our forum or send an email directly.
