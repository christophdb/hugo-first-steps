      title: Frequently Asked Questions
      items:
          - q: Can I use SeaTable Cloud for free?
            a: 'With our Free subscription, you can use SeaTable Cloud permanently with up to 25 users at no cost. By registering, you conclude such a subscription.<br><br>If the limits or features of the Free subscription are insufficient, you can upgrade at any time to the paid Plus or Enterprise subscription with higher limits and extended features.'
          - q: Can I test the Enterprise features?
            a: We can upgrade your Free or Plus subscription to an Enterprise subscription for a limited time at no cost. [Please send us a corresponding request via team management](https://account.seatable.io/).
          - q: What is a team and what is a user?
            a: In SeaTable Cloud, you collaborate in teams. Each team member has a user account and is thus a user. (A team can also have just one member.)<br><br>When registering for SeaTable Cloud, a team is created. The first user is the team administrator. The team administrator can add more users to the team and manage existing team members. The administrator can also appoint one or more additional team members as team administrators.<br><br>A user is identified by their email address. A user can only be assigned to one team.
          - q: Can I change the number of users in my team?
            a: 'You can adjust the number of users in your team at any time.<br><br>With SeaTable Cloud Free, Plus and Enterprise, you can do this yourself by adjusting your subscription in [team management](https://account.seatable.io/). For SeaTable Dedicated, please contact your personal contact person.<br><br>In the Free subscription, the team size is limited to 25. With SeaTable Cloud Plus and Enterprise as well as SeaTable Dedicated, the number of users is unlimited.'
          - q: Can I combine different subscriptions in my team?
            a: 'Combining different subscriptions in one team is not possible. A team with all its members is either on the Free, Plus or Enterprise subscription.<br><br>You can distribute your users across two or more teams. These teams can have different subscriptions.'
          - q: Can I combine different billing periods?
            a: 'Combining different billing periods in a Plus and Enterprise subscription is not possible. A team with all its members is billed either monthly or annually.<br><br>With annual payment, you pay about 20% less than with monthly billing.'
          - q: How can I cancel a Plus or Enterprise subscription?
            a: 'You can cancel your Plus and Enterprise subscription at any time in [team management](https://account.seatable.io/) at the end of the current subscription period. Until then, you can continue to use all features of the canceled subscription.<br><br>When the cancellation takes effect, your paid subscription will be converted to a Free subscription. So you can still access your data in SeaTable Cloud even after the paid subscription ends. Due to the lower limits of the Free subscription, you may only have read access to your bases after the downgrade.'
          - q: 'What happens when I reach my subscription limit?'
            a: 'When you reach your row or storage limit, we will inform you. You can still access your bases and tables; but you cannot create additional rows or upload files.'
          - q: 'Which payment methods can I use?'
            a: 'You can generally pay by credit card as well as with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Enterprise subscribers with annual payment and 10 or more users can also pay by bank transfer.'

            a: 'You can adjust the billing address at any time in [team management](https://account.seatable.io/).<br><br>Subsequent changes to an invoice are not possible.'
          - q: 'What about data protection and security?'
