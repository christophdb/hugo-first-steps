## How do you find the right ideas for your social media posts?

Creating an [editorial plan for social media]({{< relref "posts/redaktionsplan-social-media" >}}) requires careful planning and a precise knowledge of your content strategy and the platforms you want to use. Because [Reddit]({{https://www.reddit.com/r/SeaTable/}}),Tiktok, [LinkedIn]({{https://www.linkedin.com/company/seatable/}}) and co. each work according to their own rules with **different target groups and media formats**. Nevertheless, content ideas for Instagram or LinkedIn, for example, can easily work on other channels. The right content and the right format depend very much on your target group. Depending on demographic criteria - age, level of education, income - people react differently to graphic designs and text formulations.

As always in marketing, the key to success is therefore the most **accurate information possible about your target group**, which you have determined as part of your [marketing strategy]({{< relref "posts/20250318-marketingplan" >}}), paired with creativity. Use the findings from your [marketing management tool]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/marketing" >}}). Your content for social media does not always have to consist of memes or in-depth content. Rather, a good mix is crucial. Variety is one of the success factors for successful content on social media. Another is regularity, because only with regular posts can you strengthen the **brand awareness** of your followers towards your company and increase traffic from social media to your own website. To ensure that you don't run out of material for posts despite having a well-thought-out [social media plan]({{< relref "templates/marketing/social-media-plan" >}}), we have some content ideas that you can implement on social media **quickly and without much effort**. This will help you maintain your social media channels even on stressful days.

## Tip 1: Behind the scenes

Take your followers with you into your everyday life and show them more about your company and your daily tasks. Simply pull out your smartphone and record a few stories - and you'll pick up your followers on [Instagram]({{https://www.instagram.com/seatable_com/}}) with interesting content from everyday life! This is particularly useful at events, conferences or similar, when exciting things happen away from the traditional office routine.

## Tip 2: Introducing the team

Introducing individual employees makes the relationship between followers and the company more approachable. Of course, only those who want to should take part! The **personal insight into the team** gives your customers and those who want to become customers an idea of your team spirit and will remember your company positively and, above all, as human. It often helps to see the people behind the scenes. Such images are well suited as Instagram ideas for posting short stories, for example, but also for LinkedIn.

## Tip 3: Surveys

Surveys definitely belong in every content plan for social media. They actively involve your followers and give them the opportunity to get involved in a very concrete way. It doesn't really matter whether you conduct a survey purely for fun, for research purposes or to involve your followers in a decision. Social media posts of this kind help you to find out your followers' opinions on a certain topic in an entertaining way and **encourage dialog**.

## Tip 4: Share customer feedback
Positive feedback from satisfied customers is the **best advertisement for your company and your product**. Use this feedback for your social media posts and post testimonials and customer testimonials. However, you should make sure that your feed does not only consist of excessively good customer feedback.

## Tip 5: FAQ's

Another type of social content that always works well is FAQs (= Frequently Asked Questions). This gives you the opportunity to answer frequently asked questions from your followers or generally give them an overview of your product. Nice-to-know facts can also be usefully packaged in this way.

![A FAQ is a good content idea on Instagram](FAQs-711x889.png)

## Tip 6: Product presentation

Your content ideas for Instagram, TikTok and social media in general should be a good mix of different topics. In addition to topics that have nothing to do with your day-to-day business, you should - if possible - occasionally present a **product of your company** and show your followers what exactly is so special about it. After all, your followers should also know what you actually offer.

## Tip 7: Funny videos

A good content mix also includes funny posts from time to time. **Videos are great social content** and offer a welcome change from stories and posts. You are sure to find something suitable that you can implement with your employees and make your followers smile!

## Tip 8: (Team) events

Events are a great opportunity to get your followers on board. They are not only suitable for a follow-me-around, but can also be posted as a call to action for your followers if they are public events. This content idea allows you to be active and address your followers directly.

## Tip 9: Everyday hacks and tips

Topics that users are particularly interested in are topics that have a **relationship to their lives and everyday life**. For example, give tips for more productivity in the home office or focus your life hacks on current or seasonal topics (such as: The best swimming lakes our team knows). Let your creativity run free and think about what you would like to read yourself to create appealing content for social media.

## Tip 10: Memes

Another very popular type of social content is memes, i.e. creative content in the form of images or videos. They spread rapidly on the internet and are regularly modified by users. Whether funny, sarcastic or socially critical - these content ideas contribute to more virality on social media. Simply use the latest memes and customize them.

## Tip 11: Introduce tools

It can be very interesting for some people to find out which tools companies use in their everyday work. By introducing tools and programs, you can even start a series of posts and introduce a new tool every week that makes your everyday (working) life easier.

## Tip 12: Job postings

Your followers are not just customers - employees from your industry also often look at content from other companies. So why not post job advertisements and draw the attention of professionals who are looking for a new job to you? This kills two birds with one stone: good content ideas and new staff.

## Tip 13: Competitions

Many influencers use competitions on social media to increase the **engagement** of their followers and thus increase their **reach**. As a company, you can also use this type of content on social media. If you give away your own products, you even have the opportunity to convince potential customers. When implementing this content idea, be sure to observe the guidelines of the respective platforms.

## Tip 14: Infoposts

Do you have interesting insights from your industry? Perhaps a new law has just been passed? Or will something change for your customers in the future? Keep your followers up to date with **up-to-date news**. Feel free to use graphics to package the information in a visually appealing way.

## Tip 15: Start a series

Content series create a **red thread** that runs through your channel. This attracts new followers and encourages existing followers to visit your profile regularly. This content is posted at regular intervals, ideally on specific days such as **#throwbackthursday** or **#FollowFriday**.

## Tip 16: Share successes and milestones

See your social media followers as a community and celebrate important events together with them. The x. customer, a new branch, a new product update: you decide which success is worth sharing on your channels.

## Tip 17: Debunk myths and misconceptions
There are myths in every sector and there are bound to be **curious or outrageous misconceptions and misjudgments** about your industry too. Clear them up, preferably in a charming way and with a wink.

## Tip 18: Infographics
Infographics are also very good social content that **works on all platforms**. You can use them to present complex topics in a short, concise and visually appealing way - or simply to entertain.

## Tip 19: Share a blog post
If you run a blog, then social media channels are ideal for secondary use. Share new blog articles or create infographics or stories from the articles (this also applies to podcasts or a [YouTube channel]({{https://www.youtube.com/@SeaTable}}), of course). It is also a good opportunity for you to include a link to your site.

## Tip 20: Provide facts and figures
Even if social media works primarily through images and emotions, you can also post hard facts and figures. Figures are particularly suitable in combination with the communication of important milestones. However, be careful not to simply post figures in a vacuum, but explain what they are all about and **what this figure means for your followers and customers**.
