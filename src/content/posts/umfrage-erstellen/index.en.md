Would you like to find out what the needs of your target group are or how you can further optimize your product? Or would you like to create a survey to find out how satisfied your employees are? **Online surveys** prove to be an extremely efficient tool for collecting data. The numerous advantages make them a preferred method for companies, organizations and researchers all over the world.

The following article highlights the advantages and important criteria for creating online surveys and compares seven promising tools.

The online survey proves to be an extremely efficient tool for data collection.

## Advantages of an online survey

Creating surveys **online** offers you a number of advantages. One of the biggest advantages of an online survey is the **time saved**. Instead of making tedious phone calls or walking through pedestrian zones to interview potential participants in person, you can simply create a survey digitally and publish the link online. This allows you to quickly collect a large number of responses without wasting valuable time.

In addition, the **costs** for online surveys are often considerably lower compared to traditional methods. Some tools offer their services partially or even completely free of charge. This makes it possible for smaller companies or research projects with a limited budget to conduct high-quality surveys.

Another plus point is the **global reach** that an online survey offers you. As the internet is accessible worldwide, you can easily share your survey with users all over the world. This gives you the opportunity to collect diverse and representative data from different regions and cultures.

A key advantage of creating surveys online is the ability to track and analyze the results in **real time**. Modern survey platforms offer **evaluation tools** that immediately convert the collected data into meaningful statistics and graphics. In this way, you can quickly gain insights and make informed decisions without having to rely on manual evaluation of questionnaires.

## 10 commandments of question formulation according to Porst

In order to achieve good results, it is particularly important that you formulate your questions carefully when creating a survey. Poorly worded questions can lead to inaccurate or biased responses, which can affect the **validity of** your data. This would be unfortunate, especially if you have invested a lot of time and effort into the survey. To avoid such problems, Rolf Porst has formulated [ten principles](https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/upload/forschung/publikationen/gesis_reihen/howto/how-to2rp.pdf) that you should keep in mind when formulating surveys.

## What is important in surveys

In addition, it is important to consider some aspects to ensure that participants are motivated to complete your survey successfully. A high dropout rate can indicate that participants are dissatisfied, and you should avoid this at all costs.

A **clear structure** of the survey is crucial. Nobody wants to fill out a chaotic survey. Structure your questions so that they build on each other logically and are easy to understand. Avoid excessively long question descriptions and answers, as most participants prefer a **quick** and **uncomplicated** survey.

Provide **variety** in your survey to keep your participants interested. A long list of multiple-choice questions can quickly become tiring. Therefore, integrate different types of questions to motivate respondents and keep their attention.

Even after the survey is completed, it is important to show **appreciation**. Participants have invested their valuable time to help you and therefore deserve recognition. A short thank you message at the end of the survey can help participants feel appreciated and willing to participate in surveys again in the future.

With a well-designed survey, you can prevent a high drop-out rate.

You can also divide questions into clear sections and easily implement both random sequences and branched questions.

Another plus point is the ability to import questions directly, which makes the creation process even more efficient.
