When the festival season begins and the anticipation of good music and shared experiences with friends increases, it's time to pack your bags again. To ensure that your festival visit runs smoothly and is not overshadowed by problems and annoyances, **thorough preparation** is crucial.

Whether you're getting ready for the legendary [Wacken](https://www.wacken.com/de/), the thrilling [Rock am Ring](https://www.rock-am-ring.com) or the energetic [Hurricane](https://hurricane.de/de/) Festival - there are a few must-haves on every festival packing list.

Festivals bring people together and promote a sense of community.

## The festival packing list

So that you can find everything at a glance, the festival packing list is divided into six clear categories. First, the essentials are listed, which should not be missing under any circumstances. This is followed by camping equipment, food, clothing, toiletries and medicines, as well as other items that cannot be assigned to a category.

### Essentials

Festivals provide access to a diverse music program.

The most important thing for a festival is, of course, the **festival ticket**. Therefore, especially if you have a long journey, you should make absolutely sure that you have your ticket with you. You should also always have your **ID**, **health card** and **cash** with you.

However, you should leave things that you can do without or that are particularly expensive at home, as there are usually a few thieves among the crowd of strangers. Good **earplugs** are a blessing for noise-sensitive people or night owls who like to sleep long in the morning in absolute silence.

### Camping

The nights are often short amidst the noisy surroundings.

If you are attending a festival for the first time and need to purchase new camping equipment, you should make sure that your tent has **enough space** to accommodate all your belongings. If you already have a tent, make sure you check that you have **enough pegs** and that the tent is **complete** before you set off. It would be annoying if you were missing a tent pole on site.

Another important item on your festival packing list is a **pavilion**, as otherwise you can quickly get sunstroke if the sun shines for hours on end. A pavilion not only offers protection from the sun, but also from unpleasant weather conditions. As you will be spending a lot of time in the camping chair, it is also important that it is **comfortable** and of **good quality**.

### Catering

You need a lot of energy at a festival.

Some festivals offer their visitors small **supermarkets on the grounds**. Find out about this in advance so that you don't have to bring all your food and drink with you from the start.

Otherwise, the classic on every festival packing list is probably **canned** food. If this is too monotonous for you, you can also opt for **home-cooked** food, **bread** or **fresh fruit** such as bananas or apples. It is important to only take food with you that can withstand heat and sunlight. **Vegan spreads**, **muesli bars** and **nuts** are particularly suitable here.

### Clothing

The right clothes are those in which you feel comfortable.

Although sunny **weather** has been forecast, it can suddenly rain. The weather is not always reliably predictable, so it is important to be prepared for all eventualities. Make sure your festival packing list includes clothes for sunny and hot days as well as rainy days.

It can quickly become **muddy** or **dusty** on the festival site, which can also affect your clothing. Therefore, avoid light-colored shoes or clothing if you don't want to be constantly changing your clothes. Eye-catching items of clothing such as **costumes**, **headdresses** and lots of **glitter** are often very popular and welcome at festivals.

Spacer

- Shorts and long pants
- T-shirts
- Sweater or jacket
- Rain jacket or poncho
- Pyjamas

### Hygiene & medicine

The hygiene situation at festivals is often not particularly comfortable.

The following applies to all hygiene items on your festival packing list: **travel sizes** are space-saving and therefore ideal. Bringing your own **toilet paper** often proves to be a lifesaver, as it is often in short supply in the porta-potties with so many festival visitors.

Maintaining hygiene on the campsite can be a challenge. It is therefore always worth having **disinfectant** with you to wash your hands without a long walk.

Generally speaking, the distances at a festival from the tent to the stage are often long. That's why **blister plasters** are an absolute must-have if you want to enjoy several days of festival experience without pain.

- Deodorant, shampoo and shower gel

### Miscellaneous

Games are played on the campsite to pass the time.

**Bin bags** are not only useful for keeping your camp clean, but also for collecting empty returnable bottles or as protection from the wet when it rains. Another often-used savior at festivals is **duct tape**, which comes in handy when you need to repair your tent, clothing or other items.

As the distances from the parking lot to the campsite are often long, it makes sense to think in advance about the best way to transport all your equipment. Many festival visitors are particularly creative in their **means of transportation** - from handcarts and wheelbarrows to garbage cans, everything is possible to save time and energy.

- Armor tape

## More festival tips

When preparing for a festival, in addition to a well-considered festival packing list, it is also important to take other tips into account. It's worth arriving at the venue early to get a **good spot** for your tent and avoid long walks or being close to smelly porta-potties.

It is also a good idea to **consult with friends** to avoid bringing certain things twice. Above all, you should plan in advance which acts you want to see so that you don't miss out on anything and take all priorities into account - you often take on more than you can manage in the end.

It is advisable to read the **organizer's guidelines** carefully beforehand. In most cases, items such as glass bottles or charcoal barbecues are not permitted. These will be checked at the entrance and taken away from you if necessary.

### Legal

In addition to the rules that the organizer can issue for their private grounds, the general laws also apply at festivals. For example, anyone who lights a bonfire, damages other people's property or drives under the influence of drugs must expect legal consequences. To ensure that your festival visit does not get out of hand and that you can celebrate peacefully and safely with thousands of people, you should adhere to all existing rules.
