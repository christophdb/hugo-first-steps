The Haut Conseil de l'évaluation de la recherche et de l'enseignement supérieur (Hcéres) is an independent public authority in France governed by Articles L. 114-3-1 to L. 114-3-6 and R. 114-1 to R. 114-23 of the French Research Code. The main tasks of the Hcéres include

- The evaluation of all higher education and research institutions in France.
- The validation of evaluation procedures proposed by other organizations.
- The evaluation of private universities in France and abroad on request.  


Hcéres was faced with the challenge of making its complex data processes more efficient and complying with legal requirements. With SeaTable, Hcéres found a solution to centralize its data management and improve collaboration.

## Initial situation: Hcéres and the challenge of efficient data management

As an independent authority, the Hcéres is responsible for evaluating all French higher education and research institutions. Before the introduction of SeaTable, these processes were mainly managed using Excel spreadsheets. However, this method was increasingly inefficient and led to security gaps and a fragmented database. It was time to find an [Excel alternative]({{< relref "pages/excel-alternative" >}}) that would simplify the entire process and meet the requirements of the Hcéres.

## The transition from Excel to SeaTable: Why SeaTable was the right choice for Hcéres

To overcome the challenges of data management, the Département du Numérique et des Données (DND) of the Hcéres opted for SeaTable - a flexible and user-friendly platform that significantly optimized the evaluation processes. SeaTable centralized all data and enabled the Hcéres to simplify the entire evaluation process both in France and internationally.

## Implementation of SeaTable at Hcéres

The implementation of SeaTable began with a proof of concept (POC) in a single department. This pilot phase focused on the management of conventions and potential expert lists. Based on the success of this test, SeaTable was gradually extended to other departments and evaluation services of the Hcéres. Today, the agency uses the [no-code platform]({{< relref "/" >}}) SeaTable to efficiently form evaluation committees and streamline the preparation process for evaluations.
