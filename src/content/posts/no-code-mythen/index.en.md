## What does no-code development mean?

In no-code development, programmers or [citizen developers]({{< relref "posts/20250317-citizen-developer" >}}) use special no-code platforms to create applications without writing a single line of code. This means that even **employees without programming knowledge** can create the apps or databases they need. This conserves the company's (often scarce) [IT resources]({{< relref "posts/it-fachkraeftemangel" >}}). In most cases, these platforms offer **table-based database structures** with a graphical user interface on which the required elements are placed using the drag-and-drop principle.

## Myth 1: No-code development is a hype and will soon fade away

Of course, we don't have a crystal ball to tell us which technologies and trends will be important in software development in the future. But the assumption that it's not worth using no-code platforms because it's just a short-term trend is almost certainly wrong. This is based on the misconception that we are dealing with a very young technology. To name just three examples: WordPress has allowed users to create their own websites without code using the modular principle since 2003, Shopify followed in 2004, Bubble in 2012. Usable **no-code tools have been around for over 20 years** and their importance is constantly growing.

## Myth 2: No-code development requires no expertise and no effort

We keep hearing that companies try out no-code and think the results are useless. In our experience, this is usually based on **wrong expectations**. Many providers - and we too - emphasize that users can create flexible tools for a wide range of use cases in a short time with no-code or low-code. And that's not wrong. However, it does not mean that companies should start creating systems without first asking themselves what this system is actually supposed to do and for whom. A no-code platform makes it much easier for you to create your own [applications]({{< relref "posts/20250318-app-erstellen" >}}) and can therefore accelerate the digital transformation of your company. However, the path to actually starting to build your system remains the same. It takes knowledge and experience to develop **a resilient concept and a scalable application architecture**. Just not programming skills.

## Myth 3: No-code is only for simple applications

The misconception that only simple solutions can be realized without individually created code is understandable, but nevertheless false. "No code" here simply means that you can create your own applications without programming knowledge. With the right platform, however, more complex and individualized tools can also be built **with no code**, from simple task management tools to fully-fledged [ITSM]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/software-development" >}}) or CRM systems - including **automation, third-party integrations and user role management**.

## Myth 4: No-code makes developers superfluous

With the right tools, you can create beautiful and functional databases and web applications without having to write (or understand) a line of code. So do you no longer need professional developers? It depends on which application you are developing and which specific customer requirements and processes need to be mapped. A no-code tool, ideally with **API integration** and automation, can relieve **professional developers** and is a helpful tool for agile software development, for example. However, it is not a one hundred percent developer replacement - even in times of AI software development and vibe coding, which bring their own problems.

## Myth 5: No-code tools are only for citizen developers

This misconception shows very clearly how much uncertainty and how many misunderstandings lie behind the no-code myths. Interestingly, it assumes the exact opposite of the aforementioned misconception - and is just as wrong. In fact, no-code and low-code tools enable efficient citizen development with cross-functional teams. Specialist departments can quickly develop simple applications themselves, your developers can build on no-code applications and extend them, or IT and the specialist department can collaborate to develop the perfect solution.

> The right no-code platform **opens up a multitude of new and interesting possibilities** instead of limiting your options.

## Myth 6: No-code applications are insecure

The idea that these tools are only for "amateurs" often goes hand in hand with the misconception that no-code solutions are inherently insecure or pose compliance risks. In fact, all established platforms **offer a high level of technical security** and adhere to proven standards and best practices. However, this does not mean that all providers are the same. Here, too, we recommend that you check carefully. For example, the [No Code Platform SeaTable]({{< relref "/" >}}) has recently had the security of its [cloud infrastructure]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-cloud" >}}), which is hosted exclusively in Germany, confirmed by a [pentest]({{< relref "posts/20250129-pentest" >}}) and also offers an [on-premises solution]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-server" >}}) for full data sovereignty.

![Secure applications can be created with no-code development](no-code-myth-security.png)

Similar no-code myths are based on the false assumption that platform operators are solely responsible for the security of user applications. This is not the case. Secure, regularly changing passwords; two-factor authentication; defined user roles with access restrictions or no-code governance: **Precautions must also be taken on the user side** to ensure the security of their own system.

## Myth 7: No-code applications are not scalable

Scalability was indeed an issue for many platforms in the early years. Today, however, the possibilities depend more on the user and the license they are willing to pay for. In this respect, no-code providers are no different from other SaaS providers. Your preparation is important: when choosing a platform, consider possible future use cases and compare different tariffs. For example, SeaTable already offers **scripts** integrated into the free account, so that you can also create **low-code applications** at no extra cost.

## No-code myths dispelled

Now you know how to react confidently to the most common prejudices against no-code. But that's just the beginning. No-code solutions offer many opportunities to **design efficient processes and develop tailor-made applications** - without compromising on data protection or security.

## FAQ - No-code development

{{< faq "What is Citizen Development?" >}}
No-code tools allow employees outside the IT department to create their own applications for a specific need. If this is done without consultation with IT, it is referred to as shadow IT. Citizen development, on the other hand, refers to a structured approach in which these employees work together with the IT department and follow clear guidelines to ensure security and compliance.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq "What is shadow IT?" >}}
Shadow IT is when specialist departments within a company use their own solutions without the knowledge of the IT department. It harbors high risks in terms of data protection, data security and compliance rules. It also undermines the company's entire IT architecture, as these applications cannot be taken into account by IT during tool migrations, updates or support.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq "What does no-code governance mean?" >}}
Governance in the context of low-code & no-code means rules and structures within a company. The aim is to ensure that the development and use of the corresponding applications support the business objectives, take place within the framework of the existing IT architecture and minimize risks. This also includes ensuring data security and compliance, effective quality control and clearly defined responsibilities.

{{< faq "What is the difference between no-code and low-code applications?" >}}
No-code and low-code are often mentioned in the same breath, but they do not mean the same thing. While no programming knowledge is required for the former, low-code tools usually offer a basic no-code toolkit that can be expanded with individual scripts.
