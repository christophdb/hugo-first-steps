## What does no-code development mean?

In no-code development, programmers or [citizen developers]({{< relref "posts/20250317-citizen-developer" >}}) create applications using specialized no-code platforms without writing a single line of code. Modern systems often function as an AI no-code platform, supporting users through intelligent assistants during the creation process. This allows **employees without programming skills** to build the apps or databases they need. As a result, the (often scarce) [IT resources]({{< relref "posts/it-fachkraeftemangel" >}}) of the company are preserved. Most of these platforms **offer spreadsheet-based database structures** with a graphical user interface where the required elements are placed using drag-and-drop.

## Myth 1: No-code development is a hype and will soon fade away

We don’t have a crystal ball to show us which technologies and trends will be important in software development in the future. However, the assumption that it is not worth using no-code platforms because it is merely a short-term trend is almost certainly wrong. In fact, we are currently experiencing a massive boost in innovation thanks to the symbiosis of no-code and generative AI. This myth is based on the misconception that we are dealing with a very young technology. To name just three examples: WordPress has allowed users to build their own websites without code using a modular system since 2003, Shopify followed in 2004, and Bubble in 2012. Usable **no-code tools have existed for over 20 years**, and their significance continues to grow alongside AI-supported development.

## Myth 2: No-code development requires no expertise and no effort

We keep hearing that companies try out no-code and think the results are useless. In our experience, this is usually based on **wrong expectations**. Many providers - and we too - emphasize that users can create flexible tools for a wide range of use cases in a short time with no-code or low-code. And that's not wrong. However, it does not mean that companies should start creating systems without first asking themselves what this system is actually supposed to do and for whom. A no-code platform makes it much easier for you to create your own [applications]({{< relref "posts/20250318-app-erstellen" >}}) and can therefore accelerate the digital transformation of your company. However, the path to actually starting to build your system remains the same. It takes knowledge and experience to develop **a resilient concept and a scalable application architecture**. Just not programming skills.

## Myth 3: No-code is only for simple applications

The misconception that only simple solutions can be realized without individually created code is understandable, but nevertheless false. "No code" here simply means that you can create your own applications without programming knowledge. With the right platform, however, more complex and individualized tools can also be built **with no code**, from simple task management tools to fully-fledged [ITSM]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/software-development" >}}) or CRM systems - including **AI automations, third-party integrations and user role management**.

## Myth 4: No-code makes developers superfluous

With the right tools, you can create beautiful and functional databases and web applications without having to write (or understand) a line of code. So do you no longer need professional developers? It depends on which application you are developing and which specific customer requirements and processes need to be mapped. A no-code tool, ideally with **API integration** and automation, can relieve **professional developers** and is a helpful tool for agile software development, for example. However, it is not a one-hundred-percent replacement for developers – even in the age of AI software development and vibe coding, which bring their own set of challenges. The developer's role is shifting more toward that of an architect who uses the AI no-code platform for complex logic building blocks.

## Myth 5: No-code tools are only for citizen developers

This misconception shows very clearly how much uncertainty and how many misunderstandings lie behind the no-code myths. Interestingly, it assumes the exact opposite of the aforementioned misconception - and is just as wrong. In fact, no-code and low-code tools enable efficient citizen development with cross-functional teams. Departments develop simple applications quickly on their own, while your developers build upon no-code applications or AI workflows and expand them, or IT and the specialized department collaboratively develop the perfect solution.

> The right no-code platform **opens up a multitude of new and interesting possibilities** instead of limiting your options.

## Myth 6: No-code applications are insecure

The idea that these tools are only for "amateurs" often goes hand in hand with the misconception that no-code solutions are inherently insecure or pose compliance risks. In fact, all established platforms **offer a high level of technical security** and adhere to proven standards and best practices. However, this does not mean that all providers are the same. Here, too, we recommend that you check carefully. For example, the [No Code Platform SeaTable]({{< relref "/" >}}) has recently had the security of its [cloud infrastructure]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-cloud" >}}), which is hosted exclusively in Germany, confirmed by a [pentest]({{< relref "posts/20250129-pentest" >}}) and also offers an [on-premises solution]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-server" >}}) for full data sovereignty. Especially when using AI features within no-code solutions, this data protection (GDPR compliance) is essential.

![Secure applications can be created with no-code development](no-code-myth-security.png)

Similar no-code myths are based on the false assumption that platform operators are solely responsible for the security of user applications. This is not the case. Secure, regularly changing passwords; two-factor authentication; defined user roles with access restrictions or no-code governance: **Precautions must also be taken on the user side** to ensure the security of their own system.

## Myth 7: No-code applications are not scalable

Scalability was indeed an issue for many platforms in the early years. Today, however, the possibilities depend more on the user and the license they are willing to pay for. In this regard, no-code providers do not differ from other SaaS providers. Preparation is key: When choosing a platform, consider future use cases – such as the later integration of AI algorithms for data processing – and compare different plans. For example, SeaTable already offers **scripts** integrated into the free account, so that you can also create **low-code applications** at no extra cost.

## No-code myths dispelled

Now you know how to confidently respond to the most common prejudices against no-code. But that is just the beginning. No-code solutions offer many opportunities to **design efficient processes and develop tailor-made, AI-powered applications** - without compromising on data protection or security.

## FAQ - No-code development

{{< faq "What is Citizen Development?" >}}
No-code tools allow employees outside the IT department to create their own applications for a specific need. If this is done without consultation with IT, it is referred to as [shadow IT]({{< relref "posts/schatten-it" >}}). Citizen development, on the other hand, refers to a structured approach in which these employees work together with the IT department and follow clear guidelines to ensure security and compliance.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq "What does no-code governance mean?" >}}
Governance in the context of low-code & no-code means rules and structures within a company. The aim is to ensure that the development and use of the corresponding applications support the business objectives, take place within the framework of the existing IT architecture and minimize risks. This also includes ensuring data security and compliance, effective quality control and clearly defined responsibilities.

{{< faq "What is the difference between no-code and low-code applications?" >}}
No-code and low-code are often mentioned in the same breath, but they do not mean the same thing. While no programming knowledge is required for the former, low-code tools usually offer a basic no-code toolkit that can be expanded with individual scripts.
