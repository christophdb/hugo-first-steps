## What is Master Data Management?

Master data management, also known as master data management, is the **administration of a company's central, business-relevant information**. This includes, for example, employee and customer data, product information or key financial figures. Master data management ensures that there is only **one single master data record** for all this information, which is complete, up-to-date and error-free. This avoids inconsistencies and increases the efficiency of your business processes.
