**SeaDays 2024** is over, and we can look back on two intensive and inspiring days in the Senate Hall of Mainz University. For the second time, around 50 participants - including administrators and project managers - met to discuss the latest developments around Seafile and SeaTable and to provide their feedback.

Day one was all about **Seafile**, the **powerful sync-and-share solution**. Participants had the unique opportunity to talk directly to the developers, learn about planned features and put forward their own wishes and ideas. On the second day, the focus was on **SeaTable**, the **no-code database and app-building solution**, where the community had the opportunity to discuss best practices, challenges and future plans in depth.

Whether large all-in-one solutions or smaller projects - the SeaDays provided the perfect platform for personal exchange and networking within the Seafile and SeaTable community. Many thanks to our speakers **Eloy Crespo**, **Stephan Lehniger**, **Ko Smidt**, **Matthias van Laar**, **Lisa Kleinman**, **Christian Livadaru** and **Stephan Heinrich** for making this event possible!

## Insights that excite and inspire

In addition to new insights into **exciting developments**, the event also fostered **lively discussions** and **inspiring conversations**. The enthusiasm was palpable - especially when it came to the new products, which made some people's eyes light up.

One particularly interesting topic that was frequently addressed was the possibility of hosting data **on-premises**. The increasing awareness of data security and the desire for customized solutions have shown us that on-premises solutions are in high demand: The demand for on-premises options is high. This was a valuable insight for us and shows that we are on the right track with our offering.

One of the highlights was the Q&A session with our developers Jonathan and Daniel. Both took plenty of time to answer the numerous questions from the participants. This direct exchange was a great opportunity to dive deeper into technical details and openly address their ideas and concerns.

In the evening, the event ended in a pub brewery in Mainz. Over delicious food and relaxed conversation, the participants were able to make new contacts and share their impressions of the day in a relaxed atmosphere.

### Positive feedback and new impetus

The feedback on the event was overwhelmingly positive. With an average rating of 5.5 out of 6 points, the participants' high level of satisfaction was clearly reflected. What was particularly pleasing was that all respondents stated that they would like to attend again next year. Of course, there is always room for improvement, and we take the feedback from our participants very seriously in order to further optimize SeaDays and make it a successful event again next year.
