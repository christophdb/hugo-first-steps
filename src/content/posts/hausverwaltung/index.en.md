**Property rental** is a profitable business for individuals, companies, and municipalities alike. If you manage properties, you need to ensure effective **property management**—whether you’re renting out a few apartments privately or managing a large portfolio as a company.

This article explains what to keep in mind with property management and how you can digitize your real estate management.

## What Is Property Management?

Property management primarily involves managing individual rental units. In this sense, a property management company is a business that handles the **management of rented residential buildings, condominiums, and commercial properties**. These properties do _not_ have to be owned by the management company.

As an owner, you are responsible for managing and renting out your properties.

There are **external property management companies** that support property owners with management or take over the process entirely. This means they ensure the properties are well-maintained and that operations run smoothly. They are compensated by the owners for this administrative work.

{{< warning headline="Property Management vs. Janitor" text="Property management is often confused with the **janitor**. However, the janitor is just an employee or service provider for the management company and mainly performs maintenance tasks." />}}

There are also many **private owners** who handle the administrative tasks themselves—especially when there are only a few tenants. This saves the cost of hiring an external management company.

A **property manager** refers to a self-employed individual who manages their own or others’ rental properties.

## When Should You Hire an External Property Management Company?

If you **own and rent out multiple properties**, it’s often wise to hire a professional property management company. These firms are usually experienced in real estate and have established processes for efficiently managing your rental units. Especially if you use your properties as an **investment** and have another full-time job, you often lack the **time** to take care of every property and tenant issue yourself.

In this case, you should consider whether the **cost of external property management** is worth it: The more tenants you have, the more worthwhile this becomes. You can specify in a contract exactly which tasks you delegate to the company and who is responsible for things like payment reminders, maintenance, or tenant communication. Of course, if you feel up to it, you can also handle all property management tasks yourself.

Despite high costs, real estate is a [profitable investment](https://www.immoanleger.de/10-gruende-immobilien-investieren/) in the long run, as property values rise and you can move in yourself if needed.

## Property Management in Homeowners’ Associations

Sometimes, you can’t avoid professional property management and have no chance to handle all property matters yourself. Often, when you buy a **condominium**, you also acquire shares in common property (such as green spaces, stairwells, and roofs), which belong to the **homeowners’ association** and must be managed by a property manager.

In this case, the management company also takes care of green spaces, for example.

The **German Condominium Act** legally defines which tasks the property manager must handle. You should keep an eye on whether the management company is fulfilling its duties properly to spot any untrustworthy companies.

## What Tasks Are Involved in Property Management?

The tasks of property management vary depending on the number and size of properties and are not to be underestimated. They go far beyond just monitoring rent payments and include all activities related to the property. These include selecting new tenants, communicating with tenants and service providers for repairs, as well as billing operating costs and reading heating, water, and electricity meters.

The tasks of a property manager are regulated by the Condominium Act and can be divided into various **categories**. This shows how diverse property management is and that it requires knowledge not everyone naturally has.

**Business/Financial**

- Monitoring rent payments
- Managing community funds
- Checking invoices
- Managing dunning processes
- Preparing heating and operating cost statements

**Technical**

- Ensuring safety (e.g., fire protection)
- Maintenance work
- Monitoring consumption (water, heating, electricity)
- Modernization projects
- Instructing and supervising service providers

**Legal**

- Managing leases, rent increases or reductions
- Enforcing legal requirements
- Documenting move-in/move-out inspections

**Organizational**

- Organizing owners’ meetings
- Communicating with tenants
- Selecting new tenants
- Handling complaints
- Communicating with authorities

The tasks of property management go far beyond just monitoring rent payments.

Property management involves many tasks, which can be a lot of work, especially for working owners. That’s why many private owners consider hiring an external management company to handle all tasks related to their rental properties. You should personally weigh whether outsourcing is necessary, as it means giving up a significant amount of **control** over your own properties.

## Managing Properties: Software for Property Management

Whether you rent out a few apartments privately or manage properties on a large scale, a software solution for property management must always provide a structured **overview of all properties, tenants, payments, documents, and tasks**. User-friendly no-code databases like SeaTable are ideal for this.

### Everything at a Glance

The more properties you manage, the harder it is to keep track. To collect all important information in one central place, a **database** with a graphical user interface is ideal. Always know who lives in which property and what needs to be done for each one. Bundle data such as address, size, and features of your rental units, and store photos and floor plans of your properties. With a well-organized table, you have an optimal overview, especially for a quick portfolio.

Here’s what a property management database in SeaTable could look like:

### Documenting Rental Income and Tenant Information

To always know whether your tenants have paid rent on time, you should centralize this data in your property management software. By listing your rental income monthly, you can immediately see if a tenant is behind. Store confidential information about your tenants (e.g., salary and creditworthiness) in a clear table as well.

### Keeping Track of Maintenance and Repairs

As a landlord, you need to take care of repairs, modernization, and maintenance. To stay organized, you should document both urgent and regular tasks carefully. Record orders, repair appointments, and invoices in a table. Your tenants rely on a management company that reliably coordinates service providers so important issues—like a broken faucet—are fixed right away.

If you own multiple properties, coordinating contractors and maintenance can take a lot of time.

## Conclusion

**Property management software** needs to do a lot. When choosing and testing software, ask yourself these questions: Can you use the software to…

- clearly organize all information about your rental properties?
- document your monthly rental income?
- record confidential information about your tenants?
- coordinate service providers and handle maintenance orders?
