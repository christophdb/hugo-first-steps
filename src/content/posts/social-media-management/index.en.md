## Social media strategies you should know about

In order to be successful as a company on social media in the long term, you should consider a social media strategy. What do you want to achieve with your digital presence? What goals are you pursuing? Possible strategies in social media management are

- **Brand awareness**: Do you want to make your brand better known? But how do you get more people talking about your brand? Giving your brand an identity**through clever storytelling** can be the solution. Attention-grabbing content also gives you more reach than boring posts.
- **Customer relationship**: Do you need data on what your customers think about your brand and what you want? Is it even better customer support? Do you need to organize more events or helpful how-to videos? Get in direct contact with your target group and align your marketing and social media content accordingly.
- **Lead generation and sales**: How do you need to formulate your posts so that a person clicks on the link in your bio?

A good [social media plan template](https://seatable.io/en/social-media-management/#Social-Media-Plan_von_SeaTable) will help you improve your marketing strategy.
- **Interactions and recommendations**: Do you want your customers to become ambassadors for your brand? In this case, engagement is required under your social media posts. Your posts should encourage your followers to like the post, share it or link other users in the comments. An active action makes the difference between an orphaned channel and helpful, entertaining content that people are happy to recommend.

## The most important social media platform for you

In 2023, an [online survey](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/463928/umfrage/wichtigste-social-media-plattformen-fuer-marketingverantwortliche/) revealed which **platform** is the most important for those responsible for social media management. According to the survey, Facebook is in the lead, followed at some distance by Instagram and LinkedIn.

Facebook is far ahead compared to other platforms.

However, which platforms are important for you depends on who your **target group** is. Do you want to reach more of the younger generation with your content? Then **Instagram** and **TikTok** are your platforms of choice. Are you marketing a product that primarily appeals to creatives, DIY enthusiasts and people interested in lifestyle? Then you should consider a profile on **Pinterest**. If your company focuses on B2B marketing and appeals to a professional target group, **LinkedIn** is an effective platform.

Users can create, share and rate content on all social media. Nevertheless, the platforms vary in their characteristics. Whether **microblogging**, **videos** or **images** - choosing the right platform plays a decisive role for your **content**. When managing social media, also take into account the specific usage habits and interaction options in order to make the best possible use of the full potential of each platform.

## Create and optimize social media profiles

When creating your social media profiles, there are also all sorts of things to consider in order to shine with an optimal profile. First, formulate a **mission statement** that you are aiming for with your channel. Is your goal to produce entertaining, inspiring or informative content? Do you want to engage in a respectful dialog with your followers or would you prefer to be more approachable and personal? What message do you want to convey?

There are optimum **image sizes** for profile and cover images for each platform (and also for posts, stories and videos). On Instagram, for example, you are best off with 180Ã—180 pixels for a profile picture. Research the formats you need and use them. When creating your bio, make sure that you fill in **all fields** and use appropriate **keywords**.

Try to maintain a consistent **corporate identity** on your profiles too. For example, use the same colors and the same profile picture on all your channels to create a higher **recognition value** for your followers. Don't forget to **link** your other social media channels or your website to increase traffic on all channels.

On TikTok and Instagram, you also have the option of **pinning** relevant posts to the top of your profile. For example, do you often get the same question from your community? Simply pin a post that answers the question and refer to it in future.

Aesthetics play an important role in social media.

## Criteria for good content

One of the most important rules in social media management is that **quality** comes **before quantity**. This applies to both your channels and your content. It is better to use two channels particularly well than to neglect many channels and not really do justice to any one platform. It is better to post less frequently, but with **high-quality and relevant content**. This will inspire users and gain valuable followers.

A corporate identity is also a must when it comes to content. **Design**, **language** and **behavior** should run like a red thread through your profile. With a **consistent, well thought-out concept**, you can shape your impact both internally and externally. Some even go so far as to plan their feed well **in advance** in order to coordinate the colors of all posts.

However, the basis for good content is the content itself. Surprise your followers with creative and **varied posts**. Stand out from the crowd and come up with your own **categories**. If you run out of ideas, don't be afraid to ask your **community** directly what kind of content they would like. This will not only help you to better understand the preferences of your target group, but also create a closer bond.

## Practical tips for your social media management

You face a variety of challenges in social media management. A targeted and strategic approach can help you to successfully tackle these and exploit the potential of the platforms. Common problems and possible solutions are:

- **Low attention**: Increase attention by using eye-catching visual elements. Creative and appealing content and the use of trending topics can increase your reach.
- **Post regularly**: A constantly filled content calendar helps you to maintain a consistent publishing rhythm. You can use automation tools to post on public holidays, Sundays and during company vacations.
- **Individual content**: Don't bore your followers by repeating the same content on all platforms. Instead, adapt your content to the respective target groups of the platforms and create customized posts.
- **Lack of interaction**: Are you already regularly posting interesting content, but the likes and comments aren't coming? In addition to targeted questions, use surveys and actively involve your community in decision-making processes. A prompt response to comments and feedback is also essential to encourage engagement.
- **Handling crises**: In general, in the event of a crisis, such as a shitstorm, it is advisable to develop a crisis plan with clear communication guidelines in advance. Respond transparently, sensitively and quickly to criticism in order to protect your reputation and regain the trust of your community.

## Analysis of your social media channels

If you want to build a successful digital presence, **analyzing** your social media channels plays a key role. This will give you valuable insights that you can use to improve your social media strategy in a targeted manner.

If you have not yet dealt intensively with this topic in social media management, it is advisable to start with a **social media audit**. This comprehensive review of your social media presence includes an analysis of previous activities, content, interactions and the **performance** of your channels. Pay particular attention to **important key performance indicators (KPIs)**.

In addition to identifying your own strengths and weaknesses, you can also derive **best practices** from the industry.

In addition to analyzing the figures, don't forget the **feedback** from your followers. Likes, comments and other forms of interaction serve as direct feedback from your target group. This analysis enables you to understand their needs and wishes and adapt your content accordingly.
