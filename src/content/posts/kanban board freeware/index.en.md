## What should you look out for when choosing the right Kanban tool?

Kanban is a method that is easy to implement and does not require any special technical setups. Nevertheless, you should not make a hasty decision for or against a **digital Kanban board**. Available additional functions, the price, user-friendliness and flexibility are important factors that will ultimately have an impact on your satisfaction and the acceptance of the new software in the team. This is because some Kanban board tools differ significantly from one another. We recommend considering these criteria in particular to ensure that the tool is ultimately **optimally suited to the requirements of your team** and project.

\- **Task management functions:** Can you define subtasks, create checklists, set deadlines and alerts and assign tasks (automatically) to employees?

\- **WIP limits:** Work in Progress limits are an important element in actively preventing your available resources from being overloaded. Can you define and control limits in the tool?

\- **Real-time collaboration:** Can you actually see the current status of tasks, or only with a time delay? Does the tool offer integrated chat and notification functions for a quick exchange?

\- **Integrations:** Can existing tools such as calendars, email or messenger services be seamlessly integrated?

\- **Reporting:** Can you evaluate your processes, record important metrics and create reporting dashboards?

\- **Price and scalability:** How far can you get with Kanban Board freeware and can you scale without needing a new tool?

\- **User-friendliness:** Does your team need onboarding or is the tool intuitive to use?

\- **Security and data protection:** Does the tool offer access restrictions and two-factor authentication? Is it data protection compliant or could you run into data protection issues?

Unlike SeaTable, however, **Python scripts, for example,** are not integrated.

**Advantages:** Linking of data records, automation, basic Kanban functions

**Disadvantages:** steep learning curve, no advanced Kanban functions or metrics, limited chat function
