## What are the advantages of an online survey?

Knowing the needs and expectations of existing and potential customers is more important than ever for companies today. It is easy to find alternatives online for almost any product or service. Knowing your target group precisely is therefore an invaluable competitive advantage. And the most effective way to achieve this is to ask your (potential) customers directly. Conducting a corresponding **survey online** offers you a number of advantages:

- You save a lot of time with an online survey and can simply create a questionnaire digitally instead of making tedious phone calls or approaching passers-by in pedestrian zones.

- Online surveys are often considerably cheaper than traditional methods. With many tools, an online survey can also be created free of charge.

- Your reach is significantly greater with an online survey. You can collect representative data from different regions and countries.

- As soon as you start your survey online, you can track and analyze the responses in real time and no longer have to wait for lengthy manual evaluations.

## Create a survey online: Tools in comparison

Your next customer or employee survey is coming up and now you want to create your online survey, free of charge if possible. We have tested seven survey tools for you based on various criteria, including **user-friendliness, customizability, data protection, analysis functions and costs**.

### Doodle

If you are looking for an uncomplicated way to plan appointments with several participants, Doodle is a good and popular choice. The application impresses with its user-friendly and minimalist design. Doodle focuses on offering **polls for scheduling**, but is unsuitable for other polls.

In terms of data protection, the tool is not fully convincing despite **SSL encryption**. This is because Doodle transfers personal data to foreign servers and uses tracking tools. In addition, it is only possible to hide the list of survey participants in the paid Pro version. The price for this is €6.95 per month.

- **Application area:** scheduling
- **User-friendliness:** very good
- **Customization options:** low
- **Data protection:** medium
- **Analysis function:** good
- **Costs:** partly free of charge

### Google Forms

This tool is ideal for users who want to create a survey online but do not need complex functions. Google Forms is particularly user-friendly thanks to its clear interface and structure. You can use **different question types** and **integrate images and videos**. You can also divide questions into clear sections and easily implement both random sequences and branched questions.

In addition, Google Forms meets all the requirements of the GDPR and other global compliance guidelines, which ensures the security of your data.

- **Scope of application:** surveys and quizzes
- **Ease of use:** very good
- **Customization options:** high

The clear **step-by-step introduction** should make it easy for you to set up a survey online. A special highlight is the **extensive question database**, which serves as a source of inspiration and a template.

In terms of data protection, Surveymonkey **meets the requirements of the GDPR** and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, the tool is not cheap in comparison. The free basic version only offers very limited functions, while extensions start at €39 per person per month.

- **Application area:** surveys and quizzes
- **User-friendliness:** okay
- **Customization options:** high
- **Data protection:** good
- **Analysis function:** ok

Survio offers a **user-friendly platform** for creating and conducting surveys in various application areas. Thanks to the many templates and question types as well as the option to organize the survey by page, you can easily create a clearly structured questionnaire. The option to hide or show **questions based on previous answers** is very interesting, albeit for a fee.

In terms of data protection, the tool meets the requirements of the GDPR and offers additional security through encryption with an SSL certificate. Survio also impresses with **extensive analysis functions**, including viewing individual responses and displaying survey statistics. The basic version is free, while an extension for additional functions costs €25 per month.

LamaPoll is **GDPR-compliant** and operates its servers in Germany. It also provides transparent data protection documents for companies. If you use this tool for your online survey, you will have to dig a little deeper into your pocket. The free basic version only allows surveys with a maximum of 50 participants.

- **Application area:** surveys
- **User-friendliness:** fine
- **Customization options:** high
- **Data protection:** very good
- **Analysis function:** good
- **Costs:** expensive, partly free

### Alchemer

Alchemer, formerly Surveygizmo, is primarily aimed at companies. The many different question types and evaluation options allow detailed market research and customer surveys. However, the many options also make it somewhat more difficult for new users to create their first questionnaire. The **very good analysis functions** and free support are a plus point.

However, this package also comes at a price. Alchemer does **not offer a free basic version** but only a 14-day free trial period. Small teams of up to three people pay €55 per month for the cheapest package. Alchemer meets the requirements of the GDPR and CCPA, among others, and is ISO 27001 certified

## FAQ - Conduct a survey online

{{< faq "What to look out for in an online survey?" >}}
If you create a survey online, the same principles apply as for an offline survey. In addition to a clear incentive for the participants, you should pay particular attention to the wording of your questions. We recommend that you follow the **10 commandments of question formulation** according to German social scientist Rolf Porst. Make sure your survey has a logical structure and avoid long question descriptions and answers. Integrate different types of questions and ensure variety. This will prevent participants from starting your survey online but not completing it. A short thank you message at the end of the survey can help participants feel appreciated and willing to take part in surveys again in the future.

{{< faq "What are the 10 commandments of question formulation according to Porst?" >}}
In order to achieve good results, it is particularly important that you formulate your questions carefully when creating a survey. Poorly worded questions can lead to inaccurate or biased responses, which can affect the validity of your data. This would be unfortunate, especially if you have invested a lot of time and effort into the survey. To avoid such problems, social scientist Rolf Porst has formulated ten principles that you should definitely consider when creating a questionnaire. Avoid

- difficult, ambiguous terms

- long and complex questions

- double stimuli and negations

- insinuations and suggestive questions

- Questions about information that respondents do not have

- Questions without a clear time reference

- Answer categories that overlap

- Questions with influencing context

- Unclear terms not to be defined

{{< faq "How much does an online survey tool cost?" >}}
Software that you use to create customer surveys is usually web-based. Users purchase a license and use the tool online. How much an online survey can cost also depends on the complexity of your online survey. The more functions you need, the more expensive it will be. You can create a simple online survey free of charge with most tools. However, this usually means that you are missing out on reasonable analysis and reporting functions.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq "How do you choose the right tool?" >}}

- How does the tool guarantee data protection and data security?
