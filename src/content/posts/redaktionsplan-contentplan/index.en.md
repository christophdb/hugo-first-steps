In today's world, an online presence is crucial for the success of your company. You need to publish content regularly via social media, your website, a blog or formats such as a podcast. This could be articles, explanatory videos or infographics, for example. A content plan, also known as an editorial plan, helps you to **plan and create all your content**.

Read on to find out how you can **easily create your content plan using a free template** and what you need to bear in mind when doing so.

## What are the advantages of a content plan

The use of a comprehensive content plan has several advantages for your marketing:

### The content appears as planned

You can always keep an eye on deadlines for drafts and important publication dates with a content plan. It is clear **who** has to **complete which tasks by when**. Personnel bottlenecks when creating the content plan or missed deadlines are therefore a thing of the past.

### Responsibilities are clearly distributed

You should assign a responsible person to each planned article. This way, everyone in the team can **filter** the **editorial plan according to their to-dos** and see at a glance what needs to be done. **Coordination across several people or departments is easier** if it is clear who is involved in which project and who still has capacity.

### No content is lost

Furthermore, good content planning means that no content is lost. Every idea can be recorded directly and given a place in the queue. The content plan offers you a central location for **collecting ideas for future articles**, social media posts, etc.

### Keeping an overview with a content plan

The content plan also helps you to maintain an **overview** in the stressful day-to-day editorial work. It is a support for the **successful planning and implementation of projects** in all areas of content marketing.

### Pursue a content strategy

After all, good content planning allows you to **focus on** your **goals**. These can be, for example, **greater reach, more followers or more leads**. In the content plan, a common thread can be established between the posts and followed consistently.

## Checklist for your content planning

The next step is to choose the right framework for your content plan. The following checklist will help you to create a good editorial plan template that you then only need to fill with ideas and content:

- How many channels do you want to manage?
- How often would you like to publish?
- Do you want to manage complex campaigns or just post organic content?
- Do you pursue an SEO strategy for the content?
- Which subtasks are part of content planning and which processes do you want to map with the content plan?

The answers to the questions in the checklist determine the structure and scope of the required content plan template.

## Create a content plan in 5 steps

You can get your content planning ready for use in five steps. We start with the "why". **Why do you want to do content marketing?**

### 1\. determine goals

Define the goals you want to achieve with the editorial plan. The following options are possible, for example:

- **Awareness**: More people should know your brand or your company.
- **Reach**: Your marketing messages should reach more people.
- **Traffic**: More people should visit your website.
- **Sales**: You want to gain more leads, subscribers or customers.
- **Customer loyalty**: You want to strengthen the relationship with your customers and encourage them to recommend you to others.
- **Unique position**: You want to stand out [from the competition]({{< relref "templates/marketing/competitor-analysis" >}}) with your content.
- **Expert status**: You want to make a name for yourself in the industry and become a sought-after expert on a specific topic.

Once the objectives have been defined, the next step is to decide on the appropriate media, content types and formats.

### 2\. select medium, content type and format

Important media for content marketing are usually **your website, blogs, search engines, video and social media platforms** such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. What type of content do you want to publish? Choose between **text, image, audio, video** or a mix of several content types. The possible content formats depend on which medium you choose. Content formats include blog articles, YouTube videos, [podcast episodes]({{< relref "templates/marketing/podcast-editorial-calendar" >}}), social media posts, presentations, webinars, white papers, infographics, newsletters and more.

**As a general rule,** focus on two to three formats in which you are particularly good or would like to become particularly good. These should be tailored to the usage habits and expectations of your target group.

### 3\. determine content mix and frequency

Then go into detail with your content plan. The content mix determines which content you will post. Various categories can be considered thematically:

- **Viral**: Content that corresponds to current trends or could trigger a new one.
- **News**: Content on topics that are hotly debated in your industry or generally in the news.
- **Entertainment**: Content that attracts attention and entertains your target group.
- **Guide**: Useful content that helps your target group.
- **SEO**: Content that your target group wants to find via a search engine.

For content planning, also specify **when and how often content should be published**. For example, twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday at 8 am.

### 4\. create an editorial plan

Now it's time to actually create the editorial plan. With the right tool, this is child's play. For example, select an existing template for your content plan, adapt the tables to your own requirements and insert your data.

As a minimum, your content plan should contain **columns for a working title or the content idea and the planned publication date**. Columns for documents and images, the editing status, the person responsible, the format, the medium or other information are also useful.

### 5\. define general guidelines for your content

Once you have planned the content, you should develop and document content guidelines with your team in a [workshop](https://seatable.io/en/workshop-planen/). In this way, you can ensure that the content achieves consistent quality even over a longer period of time with several participants.

These include, for example, **how to address readers, the tonality of texts, the use of emojis and hashtags, the resolution and size of images, links, formatting and more**. The guidelines round off the editorial plan and make it ready for use. If you are working with freelancers or an agency, guidelines help you to create content exactly as you want it.
