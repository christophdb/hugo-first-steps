Becoming self-employed means putting your desire for independence and self-realization into practice. Perhaps you too dream of launching your own idea on the market and making a difference. Along the way, however, you will not only encounter inspiration and a thirst for action, but also questions about the right **planning**, **financing** and the necessary **formalities**. In this article, you will find out what you should consider when setting up a company and which tool will help you to successfully advance your start-up step by step.

## The ultimate business idea

Every business start-up starts with a business idea. To turn an initial inspiration into a viable concept, it is worth taking a structured approach. A good starting point is to ask yourself a **concrete problem** that you can solve with your offer. Then check whether there is actually a demand for this solution - a **market analysis** will help you to realistically assess the opportunities and potential.

In the next step, you should clearly define what makes your offer unique: Your **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**. This will ultimately determine which niche you can occupy and which target group you want to address. This is how you turn a vague idea into a solid foundation for your future company.

## Choose the right legal form

If you want to set up a company, choosing the right legal form plays a key role. For individual founders, the **sole proprietorship** is often the best option - uncomplicated and inexpensive, but with full personal liability. If you are founding a company together with others, a **civil law partnership (GbR)** is an option. This is also easy to set up, but requires at least two founders and also means personal liability.

If you want to limit the risk, you can set up a **Unternehmergesellschaft (UG)** - a limited liability variant with low start-up costs, also known as a "mini-GmbH". The classic **GmbH** enjoys a high reputation, protects private assets and requires a share capital of 25,000 euros. There are also other legal forms such as the **Aktiengesellschaft (AG)**, the **Offene Handelsgesellschaft (OHG)** or the **eingetragene Kaufmannsunternehmen (e.K.)**, but these are mostly considered for special constellations.

{{< warning headline="Tip" >}}

Especially at the beginning of your start-up, it is important not to put off tax and legal issues. Get support from experts at an early stage so that you don't make any costly mistakes in areas such as the choice of legal form, contracts or accounting. This will ensure that your company has a solid foundation right from the start and that you can concentrate fully on your business.

## Developing the business model

To turn a business idea into a functioning company, you need a well thought-out business model. The **Business Model Canvas** is a proven tool for this. It helps you to structure all the important building blocks of your company at a glance. First of all, focus on the question of your target group: Who do you want to reach with your offer? Based on this, you define your value proposition - i.e. the specific benefits that your products or services offer.

The sources of revenue and the right pricing strategy are just as important, as they form the basis for profitability. The model is rounded off by the channels through which you distribute your offer and how you build long-term customer relationships. This creates a clear picture of how your company creates added value and asserts itself on the market.

## Create a business plan

A business plan is more than just a document - it is your roadmap as you set up your company. You use it to record your ideas in a structured way, check the feasibility of your project and show potential investors or partners that you have thought your business project through. In the following sections, you will learn step by step which elements a complete business plan contains and what you should pay particular attention to at each point.

### Executive summary

The executive summary briefly and concisely summarizes your business idea, objectives and planned approach. It should be so clear and convincing that potential investors or partners immediately understand what it is about and what added value your company offers.

### Market analysis and competitors

A thorough market analysis helps you to realistically assess opportunities and risks. Examine trends, the demand for your offer and the most important competitors. This will help you recognize where you can differentiate yourself and how you can strengthen your position in the market.

### Product or service

Describe your product or service in detail. Explain what benefits it has for your customers and why it differs from existing offers. A clear focus on the added value will also make marketing and sales easier later on.

### Marketing and sales strategy

This section shows how you want to reach your target group and retain them in the long term. Explain which channels you will use to distribute your offer, which means of communication you will use and how you will build your brand.

### Financial planning

Financial planning forms the basis for the profitability of your project. Make a realistic estimate of all costs, calculate expected sales and check when your company will start operating profitably. Sound financial planning includes costs, turnover and profitability.

### Appendix

In the appendix, you can provide additional information that complements your business plan and underlines your professionalism. This includes CVs of the founders, references or clear graphics that visualize figures and processes.

## Financing and subsidies

The right financing is a decisive factor for the successful launch of your company. **Equity capital** often forms the basis and also signals confidence in your project to potential lenders. In addition, **bank loans** - for example via your house bank or special development banks such as KfW - can be used to finance larger investments.

![Two women sit opposite each other and talk](finanzierung_bank.jpg)

In addition, when you set up a company, there are various **funding programs** available to you, for example from BAFA, EXIST or the employment agency via the start-up grant. For innovative or high-growth projects, business angels or venture capital investors can also be considered, who not only provide capital, but also experience and networks. Finally, in some cases **crowdfunding or crowdinvesting** can be used to obtain financial resources and to test the market response directly.

## Registration of the business

Before you can officially start, you need to register your business. The first step takes you to the **Gewerbeamt**, where your company will be officially registered. The **Finanzamt** then contacts you, assigns a tax number and clarifies whether you are eligible for the small business regulation. Depending on the sector, membership of the **Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK)** or the **Chamber of Crafts (HWK)** is also mandatory.

Also check your obligations to the **professional association** and **social insurance** to be on the safe side legally. Additional **permits** may be required for certain activities, such as in the skilled trades or catering sector.

{{< warning headline="Tip" >}}

With SeaTable, you can keep track of all important dates and deadlines while you are setting up your company. Use the calendar and the timeline plugin to clearly display milestones such as business plan submission, registrations, appointments with authorities or funding applications. This way, you will never miss a deadline and ensure that your start-up progresses step by step according to plan.

## Marketing strategies for your new company

Successful marketing is crucial to making your company known and gaining customers. But before you take any marketing measures, you should know your target group exactly. A **target group analysis and the creation of buyer personas** will help you to understand the typical needs, challenges and wishes of your potential customers. With this knowledge, you can select the appropriate marketing measures in a targeted manner.

- **Online marketing (SEO, SEA, social media)**: Use digital channels to increase your reach. Optimize your website for search engines, place targeted ads and actively engage with your target group on social media.
- **Content Marketing & Newsletter**: Provide valuable content that informs or entertains. This builds trust and strengthens the long-term loyalty of your customers.
- **PR & media relations (press releases, interviews)**: Traditional media increase your profile and position you as an expert in your industry. Press releases and interviews increase the visibility of your company.
- **Guerrilla marketing / events / trade fair visits**: Creative campaigns and personal encounters are memorable. Whether unusual campaigns, events or trade fair appearances - such measures create direct customer experiences.

## Networking and building partnerships

Successful networking and strategic partnerships can make all the difference for your start-up. **Incubators and co-working spaces** offer not only a place to work, but also the opportunity to meet like-minded people and exchange ideas. **Industry events and meetups** are ideal opportunities to make new contacts and learn about current trends.

You can also become active online: **LinkedIn and XING** allow you to expand your professional network in a targeted manner. **Collaborations** with start-ups or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) open up opportunities for joint projects and mutual support. In addition, there are special **start-up networks and communities**, such as the Startup Association, which offer valuable resources, mentoring and exchange opportunities.
