## éolane - a leader in electronics manufacturing, in search of more efficient data management

éolane is the leading electronic manufacturing services (EMS) company in France, developing state-of-the-art electronic circuit boards and integrating them into its customers' end products. The company was increasingly confronted with the challenges of ever more complex order processes. Traditional tools, such as spreadsheets, could no longer meet the requirements and the company was looking for a flexible and powerful solution to optimize their data and order management.

## The challenge: Managing complex order processes with traditional tools

The unstable and complicated existing tools made it difficult to manage the complex processes. In addition, the distribution of data across multiple files led to a higher risk of errors and loss of time. In addition, the previous tools did not offer precise and secure rights management, which made collaboration between the company's various departments and locations difficult.

## The path to a customized no-code solution

Bruno Vérilhac, responsible for data and processes at éolane, tested ten different tools to find the right solution for the company. In the end, he opted for SeaTable - the powerful no-code platform that enabled him to develop customized software to digitize order management.

## Digital transformation in justtwo months - how SeaTable optimized order management at éolane

In just two months, Bruno Vérilhac was able to develop and implement a customized solution with SeaTable that digitized the entire order processes. From customer requirements to tracking the schedules of support teams in the workshops, SeaTable facilitates the management of complex processes involving dozens of employees per order.

## More efficient processes and improved collaboration through no-code automation

The implementation of SeaTable led to immediate improvements. Processes were stabilized, rights management was optimized and collaboration between éolane's locations was facilitated. The ability to simplify reporting and accelerate management decision-making through automated visualizations was particularly valuable.

## Enthusiastic users: How SeaTable overcame resistance to change and increased productivity

"A tool is often introduced because it benefits the company. However, users often think that it will cost them time - a typical resistance to change. But if the needs are properly digitized and the tool makes everyday life easier, users embrace it enthusiastically," says Bruno Vérilhac. The introduction of SeaTable at éolane was quickly and enthusiastically accepted by the teams, even by employees who were previously skeptical about new digital solutions.

## Conclusion: Tailor-made no-code solution for modern data management

Today, éolane benefits from centralized and optimized order management, where every process is monitored with the utmost precision. The challenges associated with data instability and rights management are a thing of the past. SeaTable has not only solved these problems, but has also significantly improved collaboration and communication within the company. éolane is a perfect example of how digitalization, when implemented correctly, can transform a company.
