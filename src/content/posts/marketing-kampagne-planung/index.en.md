## What is a marketing campaign?

Marketing campaigns are strategically planned, time-limited sequences of marketing activities to address a specific target group and disseminate specific product and brand messages as part of the company's objectives. Typical campaigns in [marketing]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/marketing" >}}) serve to increase brand awareness and cultivate image, support product launches or, as a classic advertising campaign, specifically target the sale of certain products and services. A wide variety of channels such as radio and television, print media or online platforms can be used.

## How does a marketing campaign differ from a marketing strategy?  

The terms marketing campaign and marketing strategy are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they mean two different things. One crucial difference is the time component. While the strategy is a long-term, planned approach to implementing marketing objectives, the campaign is a **time-limited action** within the framework of this very strategy. A strategy can include many different marketing campaigns or advertising campaigns over a long period of time. This means that a well-developed strategy is the prerequisite for you to be able to start planning your marketing campaign at all.

## Six steps to success – how to successfully plan your marketing campaign

Especially in today's business world, well thought-out campaign planning is crucial in marketing. After all, potential customers are confronted with countless advertising messages every day through targeted online advertising. Whether your campaign stands out and sticks in the mind depends on the **target group-oriented approach** and the channels on which it is published.

But how can a marketing campaign plan be implemented efficiently, easily and successfully? The following six practical tips will help you on the way to your **perfect offline and online marketing campaign**.

### 1\. Allow sufficient time to develop your marketing campaign

Before you get started, realize one thing: You don't plan a marketing campaign overnight. Without solid preparation and **detailed development of all campaign steps**, it won't work. Therefore, take enough time to create your marketing campaign. If in doubt, postpone the planned campaign launch (if possible) before running a half-baked campaign.


### 2\. Definition of goals, target groups and channels

Second step in your marketing campaign planning: Define a campaign goal and target groups and create **buyer personas** if necessary. Because only if you know your target and your target groups inside out will you know which channels to use to best address them. The clearer the definition of your potential customers is, the more precisely you can create your marketing campaign and proceed with further planning. Make sure that your campaign goals are SMART, i.e. specific, measurable, attractive, realistic and time-bound.

### 3\. Analyze the competition and market

There are virtually no ideas that have not been thought of before. In other words, you may not be the only company on the market offering products or services like yours. In order to stand out from the rest and attract the attention of your target group, competition and market analysis is an absolutely crucial step for your marketing campaign. Building your marketing campaign doesn't work without looking at the competition.

### 4\. Define clear responsibilities, timelines and budgets

Successful advertising campaigns require **clear responsibilities within the team**. This is because marketing campaigns work best when everyone knows what they have to do and when. Once [project objectives]({{< relref "templates/projects/project-plan" >}}), target group and market analysis have been defined, the next step is to allocate the areas of responsibility within the team and the budget. Don't forget to set deadlines and milestones and - very importantly - define **metrics for later performance analysis**.

### 5\. Bringing measures and content together when planning the marketing campaign

Once all the organizational aspects have been taken care of, it's time to set up the content of your marketing campaign. This step involves deciding together with the team which content should be played in which format on which [channels]({{< relref "templates/marketing/social-media-plan" >}}) - always with the target group, competition and market in mind. Feel free to use a previous successful advertising campaign as an example and **analyze the strengths and weaknesses** of the content. The legal aspects are also important in this context. For every campaign measure, you should consider which copyrights apply to the photos used, when advertising guidelines must be observed and what specifications the various platforms used make.

### 6\. Implementation, monitoring and success control

Once all the measures relating to the marketing campaign have been worked out and the planning completed, it's time for implementation. In this final step, you can now play all the trump cards of your perfect preparation and reap the rewards. Speaking of successes: developing a successful advertising campaign is not just about planning and implementation. **Regular monitoring and optimization** while you are running the campaign are just as important. Once the campaign has been completed, a final analysis and evaluation follows. You should have already defined when the latter will take place in the fourth step. In this way, these important points, which can help you decisively in the planning of subsequent advertising campaigns, are not forgotten.
