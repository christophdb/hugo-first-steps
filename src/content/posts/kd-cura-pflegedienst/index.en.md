With SeaTable, Norman Kolwitz, founder of KD-Cura, wants to pioneer in his industry by digitising processes in his outpatient care service. In his search for a suitable tool, he came across SeaTable and finds the system very "charming".

## SeaTable brings digitalisation to care

[KD-Cura Pflegedienst](https://www.kd-cura.de) knows how to make the world a better place for people in need of help with the passion, helpfulness and competence of its employees. The outpatient care service was founded in 2017 and since then cannot complain about a lack of customers in the Velden district. In the meantime, the three founders employ 7 more employees and are even planning to expand their services in the form of day care.

The importance of nursing will continue to rise steadily in the coming years. The topic of digitization has not yet fully arrived in the care industry. Norman Kolwitz says that at the moment, care and health insurance companies still have to bill in analog form, which is not in keeping with the times. Digitization is an important and necessary step and must now finally arrive in the care sector. Norman Kolwitz wants to do pioneering work with SeaTable and finally digitize processes.

## Employee growth and desire for expansion requires clear structures and processes

With an increase in the number of people needing care, the number of employees in the company also grows. With each new hire, some things have to be taken into account. For example, different hourly wages have to be taken into account and various bonuses have to be set. So employment contracts become more individualized and can no longer be lumped together. Before the introduction of SeaTable, the entrepreneur worked with paper lists and slips of paper.

In addition, the company wants to grow. An expansion of outpatient care to include day care was already firmly planned before Corona, but has now been postponed until 2022. In order to be able to expand indefinitely, perhaps even in the form of a franchise, Normal Kolwitz sees the need to develop a scalable system. This requires standardised and perfected digital processes.

> It is important to optimise processes in order to be able to explain them to people who are not experts in the field. The processes have to be structured in such a way that they make the entrepreneur more or less replaceable. SeaTable is exactly the solution I was looking for.

## Standardised and perfected processes are the prerequisite for a scalable system

With SeaTable, Norman Kolwitz has found a way to set up processes in such a way that they are understandable to everyone and make him virtually replaceable as an entrepreneur. This not only makes sense for the expansion project of the care service, but also makes it easier for decision-makers to be absent. If something is urgently needed, Norman Kolwitz can quickly access the required information via his cell phone even while on vacation and confidently leave his laptop at home. Filter and search functions help to display information more clearly and find it quickly.

Personnel management is also made much easier. Individual digital personnel files can be easily created and digital checklists help both the entrepreneur and the payroll department to keep track of documents to be requested and things already done. Sticky notes and wasted paper are a thing of the past.

By digitizing his processes, the entrepreneur hopes to be a role model for others and drive progress in his industry. We are glad that SeaTable can support KD-Cura Pflegedienst in this!

> I find the system very charming because it is kept very simple and I can map my processes well with it.
