Some cultures have special traditions in connection with stag parties.

## The tradition behind the stag party

The celebration of the stag party has a long and rich tradition dating back to ancient Greece. Even back then, the farewell to bachelorhood was celebrated with great festivities.

Brides and grooms often tend to organize their farewell parties separately. However, this is by no means a must. The decision as to whether the celebrations should be held together or separately is entirely up to the future spouses and their individual preferences.

Some couples celebrate their bachelor and bachelorette parties together, known as a "Jack and Jill Party" or "Stag and Hen Party". This modern twist provides an opportunity for families and friends of both parties to come together to celebrate the couple and symbolically support the start of their lives together.

{{< warning headline="Stag party" text="Another popular option for a joint celebration before the wedding is the [stag party](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polterabend), where ceramic shards are placed in front of the bride's house to symbolize good luck for the marriage. This tradition is particularly widespread in some European countries." />}}

## What to consider before planning

The **responsibility** for planning the stag party often lies with the **groomsmen and groomswomen**. Whether you announce the big party or **surprise** the bachelors is entirely up to you. But before the planning gets into full swing, there are a few important considerations to bear in mind.

First of all, it is crucial to decide in advance which **friends and relatives** should attend the ceremony. However, this decision should ultimately be made by the future spouses, not by the witnesses alone.

The **cost** of the stag party is usually split between all participants, with the bride and groom invited as guests of honor. It is therefore important to plan and agree the **budget** carefully so that you don't offend anyone or overstretch yourself financially.
