## Challenges in the management of sensitive data

DSIM was faced with the challenge of managing sensitive data securely and accessibly at the same time. It was crucial to find a tool that not only offered security and flexibility, but was also easy to use. The [digital management]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/public-service" >}}) of sensitive information had to be centralized and legally compliant without disrupting the teams' workflows.

## The path to the optimal solution - Why the Conseil Départemental chose SeaTable

To overcome these challenges, the DSIM tested various tools, including SeaTable. SeaTable stood out for its flexibility and collaborative features, which is why it was selected for a test phase. During this test phase, the teams used the free version of SeaTable to familiarize themselves with its features. DSIM soon recognized the added value of the solution and decided to upgrade to the enterprise version in order to integrate all teams into the new system.

### Successful introduction of SeaTable - step-by-step transformation in data management

The introduction of SeaTable was a step-by-step process.

In parallel, a production server was set up to take over operational data management. This iterative approach enabled SeaTable to be smoothly integrated into the authority's workflows.

- **Centralized IT asset management:** Server and infrastructure inventory management was greatly improved and optimized by SeaTable.

This collaborative approach encouraged adoption and ensured that SeaTable met DSIM's specific requirements.  
In addition, sharing best practices with other municipalities also using SeaTable enabled the creation of an engaged community that further promoted the use of the tool.
