## How to make your event a success

If you want to manage the perfect event, there are a few things you need to consider. But where do you start if you're not familiar with event planning? How do you prevent planning errors, date clashes and cancellations? And which online event registration tool can best support you in planning an event?

There is no one universal roadmap for the multitude of possible events – they all differ in the details. Nevertheless, this article provides a rough overview of the essential steps that you should definitely consider when planning an event.

In this article, you will learn which event registration tool is free and best suits your needs, as well as how to plan an **event and implement it optimally with a checklist**.

## How online tools simplify your event planning

Online tools have revolutionized event planning and offer numerous advantages over traditional, analog methods. In the past, endless lists on paper, confusing spreadsheets in Excel and countless emails defined the planning of an event. Today, however, digital tools enable all tasks to be managed centrally and automatically. What is particularly practical is that teams **can manage their events simultaneously regardless of their location** – an invaluable advantage in times when remote working is becoming increasingly common.

Changes can be made in real time so that everyone involved can see immediately what has changed. This is particularly useful when managing guest lists or adjusting seating plans. Repetitive tasks such as sending emails can be automated with digital solutions, which not only saves you time but also avoids manual errors.

Clarity is also a major advantage. All information is bundled in one central location, so you don't have to switch between different tables or documents. This makes it much easier to keep track of tasks, deadlines and costs - a real game changer for events large and small.

## How you can manage events perfectly in 10 steps

Successfully managing events is often a challenge. It's easy to overlook something in the organizational hustle and bustle - even with clever tools. To make sure you are well prepared, we have created a helpful event checklist for you.

**1\. Define the goal of the event**

The very first thing to do when planning an event is to clearly formulate the aim of the event. What is the reason you are planning this event? Are you aiming for revenue? Do you want to increase brand awareness or customer loyalty? Perhaps you are launching a new product and using the event as a platform to introduce it to your customers?

It is also important to determine what kind of event you are planning right at the start. Always keep in mind whether you are managing an employee event, a customer event or a public event. This information will allow you to make informed decisions during the planning phase and better tailor the event to your target audience.

tip: A specific and measurable goal will help you evaluate the success of your event after the event

**2\. Develop a concept**

When developing your concept, you should focus on two main areas: organization and content. For the organizational part, for example, determine how big your event should be and how long it should last. Assign responsibilities within your team right at the start so that no tasks are neglected or overlooked.

For the content concept, it is first important to develop an event idea and, if necessary, add a suitable motto. The theme can later influence the decorations, the dress code and the entertainment program. You should also develop the program carefully to ensure that your guests are always entertained and not bored. A consistent theme is crucial to give your event a professional touch and impress your guests.

**3\. Plan your budget**

To ensure that you do not manage events that exceed your budget, it is crucial in event management to carry out detailed [budget planning](https://seatable.io/vorlage/eecso26xscgq2jzffzmwcq/) in advance. Take into account not only obvious expenses, but also less obvious costs such as licenses, travel expenses, invitations as well as dismantling and cleaning costs.

The most important cost items that you should take into account:

- **Location**: Venue rental costs including any ancillary costs such as cleaning or security services.
- **Technology**: Expenses for the rental of audio, video and lighting equipment as well as labor costs for technicians or support staff.
- **Catering**: Budget for food and beverages including service charges, gratuities and any additional expenses for special food requests.
- **Marketing**: Costs for advertising, printing invitations or flyers, and online advertising or social media promotion.
- **Entertainment**: Budget for live acts, DJs, artists or other forms of event entertainment.

By carefully planning and budgeting these main cost items as well as additional expenses for your event, you can ensure that your event stays on budget and does not incur unexpected costs. If you are managing commercial events, you can use this as a basis to calculate how much admission you need to charge to cover costs.

tip: You may be able to reduce costs through volunteers or sponsors

**4\. Create a schedule**

The most important thing when planning an event is to start early. Reservations for venues or coordinating dates with catering companies require a considerable lead time. To avoid stress during planning, it is therefore advisable to draw up a detailed schedule.

Such a schedule not only allows you to determine exactly when which step needs to be taken, but also to identify potential delays at an early stage. It is important to plan in a buffer to compensate for unforeseen changes to the plan and thus minimize possible time pressure and stress.

tip: Check in advance whether your appointment overlaps with other important dates, public holidays or school vacations

**5\. Find a location**

To be able to manage and plan successful events, you need suitable locations. You have the option of renting a location or using your own rooms. It is important to ensure that there is enough space for all guests, the catering, the stage and the technology.

When choosing the right location, it is crucial to keep the needs of your target group in mind. For example, check whether there are enough parking spaces available or whether the location is barrier-free. You may also need a garden or other specific requirements that your guests would appreciate.

**6\. Book catering and program**

Basically, hungry guests are dissatisfied guests. That's why it's important to provide catering if possible. There are various options to choose from, from buffets and menus to finger food or even food trucks. However, make sure you also offer vegetarian and vegan alternatives to meet the needs of all guests.

To make your social program more interesting and ensure your guests have a good time, there are numerous options. In addition to show performers, live bands or DJs can spread a good mood. Speakers and presenters offer an elegant way to guide your event visitors through the day or evening. With childcare, you can ensure that guests of all ages can enjoy your event.

**7\. Send invitations**

When managing events, invitations play a crucial role in your success. By using personalized invitations, you can effectively increase the number of attendees. In addition, sending "Save the Date" notifications during the planning phase can help generate interest early and ensure your guests keep the date free.

Don't forget to include important information such as date, time, location and program in the invitations. To make the booking process easier for your guests, it is a good idea to integrate a ticket booking system. With a [web form](https://seatable.io/docs/webformulare/webformulare/) in the ready-made [template](https://seatable.io/vorlage/fewxqfzbsxocskxl7hikqq/) from SeaTable, you can easily implement this step and automatically create a list of participants.

**8\. Marketing**

To ensure that your event is well attended in the end and that the planning of an event is worthwhile, it is essential to advertise your event extensively. Use all channels through which you can best reach your target group.

For internal employee events, for example, you can use notices in the company, announcements via the newsletter or e-mail invitations. You can also ask managers to mention the event in team meetings so that it spreads through the grapevine.

For commercial events such as festivals, targeted advertising via social media platforms, advertisements in relevant magazines and a reference on your own website is a good idea. If you are planning an [art exhibition](https://seatable.io/ausstellungs-und-kunstmanagement-museum-galerie/), you can rely on posters, flyers, press releases and the involvement of art and culture magazines.

It is important to start the advertising measures in good time and to present the messages in an appealing and informative way in order to arouse the interest of your target group and achieve a high number of visitors.

tip: By posting highlights, photos and videos on [social media](https://seatable.io/vorlage/lmmjwghgtye322iwdxvj7a/), you can extend the presence and impact of your event beyond the actual date

**9\. Pay attention to safety and legal matters**

To avoid getting into trouble, you should pay particular attention to legal aspects and a proper security concept when managing events. Check in advance whether official permits or insurance are required for your event. If you offer food, you must comply with the Food Act. If you are using music, you should check whether a GEMA license is required. If you use check-in or ticket systems, make sure that they comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

For large events, it is important to have plans for fire safety or medical emergencies in addition to security personnel so that your guests are not unnecessarily endangered in the event of an emergency.

**10\. Have an emergency plan**

An emergency plan is of great importance when you are managing events. Despite careful preparation, unforeseen obstacles such as extreme weather conditions or traffic obstructions can occur. It is therefore essential to have a well thought-out plan B in order to be able to react adequately to cancellations or spontaneous changes without being under time pressure or stress.

On the day of the event, it is advisable to call your service providers again to check that everything is going as planned. It is also important to maintain regular communication with everyone involved and ensure that your team is aware of the plan. Clear communication and a well-coordinated team are crucial to being able to react quickly and effectively to unforeseen situations and successfully execute the event.
