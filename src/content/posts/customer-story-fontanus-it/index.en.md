## The initial situation: Manual processes, inefficiency and high costs

At [Johannes Fontanus College](https://www.jfc.nl/), a secondary school in Barneveld, around 95% of pupils use the laptops provided by the school. Added to this are the requirements of the 300 employees. With the existing fragmented system of paper tickets, email communication and various spreadsheets, the IT department was reaching its limits. In order to streamline processes and reduce manual effort, **a robust, integrated system** for IT support, asset management and project management was to be developed.

As an educational institution managing thousands of devices and support tickets, we needed a robust yet flexible solution. SeaTable provided just that - it allowed us to create custom applications for different departments while providing a unified system for our IT operations.

## SeaTable impressed with flexibility and performance
The transition began when Ko Smidt, who had already started implementing SeaTable for the [exams department]({{< relref "posts/customer-story-fontanus-exams" >}}) at the school, told IT colleagues about his experience with the **no-code platform**. "SeaTable impressed us with its flexibility and fast implementation options," said Matthias van Laar. Within a few days, the IT team was able to set up a digital ticketing system. The **intuitive user interface** and the ability to quickly create customized solutions without extensive development were other key factors in the decision to implement SeaTable

The **implementation went remarkably smoothly**. The IT Service Desk staff and system administrators worked together to create individual interfaces tailored to the technical capabilities of the different user groups. Thanks to the user-friendly interface and **powerful automation features**, even non-technical staff can easily get to grips with the tool. The ability to develop and deploy solutions iteratively enabled continuous process optimization without disrupting daily operations.

## Visible success in a short time

With SeaTable, the IT team was able to significantly reduce the time spent on manual data entry, improve communication between IT staff and other departments and gain unprecedented **transparency over all service desk activities and asset management**. Overall, processes have been accelerated.

The most important functions from the IT department's point of view include
  
- Flexible views and filter options
- Individual form creation for different use cases
- Automation options for the assignment of tickets
- Integration options with other tools such as PRTG
- Dataset functionality for sharing information in different tables
- The ability to create custom applications for different user groups

The new student ticketing system now automatically populates student data, tracks loaner laptop availability and **assigns support tickets to the appropriate team members**. The employee ticketing system has been integrated with the network monitoring program, providing a **real-time overview of support requests and device status**.

The tool is also used for:

- **Asset Management:** Tracking of employee laptops and IT equipment
- **Project management administration:** Organizing and tracking IT initiatives
- **Facility management integration:** We develop a customized ticketing system for various facility services

One of the next steps Matthias van Laar and his colleagues are looking into is the implementation of an automated locker badge management system to be integrated into their Active Directory.

## Digitized IT support with SeaTable

With SeaTable's ability to create custom views, automate processes and integrate existing tools, the IT team was able to streamline and significantly optimize existing processes. What started as a solution to manage laptop issues has evolved into a **comprehensive management system** that supports efficiency, collaboration and strategic planning across the IT team.
