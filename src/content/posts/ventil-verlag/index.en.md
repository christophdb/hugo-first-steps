Ventil Verlag needs a flexible organisational tool for its internal publishing processes. The diverse and small organisational tasks that cannot be meaningfully mapped in any standard software led Ventil Verlag to SeaTable.

## Flexible processes require flexible tools

[Ventil Verlag](https://www.ventil-verlag.de/geschichte) is a classic niche publisher, like hundreds of others in Germany. For over 20 years, it has been producing and publishing books beyond the mainstream, mainly in the pop and vegan nutrition sections. One of its most successful publications is the book [Vegan-Klischee ade!](https://www.ventil-verlag.de/titel/1814/vegan-klischee-ade), which was published in March 2020 and became a Spiegel bestseller.

The challenges of a small publishing house are many. There is no huge organization with clearly defined roles and tasks. Instead, a small team has to react flexibly to the tasks at hand and find solutions. The core team of Ventil Verlag consists of just 6 people who are supported by external photographers, designers, editors, press staff or other freelancers. There are no fixed processes that are mapped in a publishing software, but you need a flexible software that adapts to changing requirements and processes.

## Maintaining an overview is essential in publishing

Not long ago, coordination and planning was done via email attachment to the entire team. Everyone was aware that this could not be the solution, but experiments with Google Sheets, Trello or Asana simply did not bring the desired success. A solution like Trello, while self-explanatory, is not suitable for book planning in a publishing house, where the goal is to bring together authors, photographers, illustrators and editors.

In SeaTable, on the other hand, this is very simple. While all information about the book, including cover, graphics and images, can be recorded in one table, the necessary work steps up to publication are coordinated among the participants in another table. Through the simple linking of tables, the information can be clearly structured and presented in SeaTable.

In addition, all of the publisher's books are recorded in SeaTable. No other solution can so naturally capture a wide variety of information such as title, author, category, program edition, project management, status of the manuscript, date of publication, number of pages, price, ISBN number, and the URL in the store, all of which can be easily edited at the same time. In addition, employees can easily filter out the titles that have already been published or sort them by projects that are still in progress.

## SeaTable offers the necessary flexibility for the publisher

The publisher receives exposés almost daily, which have to be sifted through and evaluated. A small publisher doesn't have the capacity to produce everything that sounds interesting. Instead, you have to develop a feeling for what interests readers and what can be produced well. Meanwhile, submitted synopses are managed in SeaTable, where they are given a status visible to everyone on the team. If a text is interesting, the author is contacted and work begins. If the script is not suitable, it is archived accordingly and not pursued further.

Since the introduction of SeaTable, coordination and communication in the team has improved significantly. Less coordination is needed because everyone knows where to find the information that is relevant to them. This means that everyone in the team can concentrate more on their own topics.

> We used to try Trello and Google Sheets, but it just wasn't a good fit. Trello limited us too much and with Google Sheets we often lacked context. With SeaTable, we always have the perfect overview.

## Summary

- Ventil Verlag always keeps track of its book process via linked tables. All information about the book can be perfectly linked to the planned next steps.
- Exposés can be ideally captured and edited with SeaTable, as the submitted text documents can be stored directly in SeaTable and meaningfully assigned a status.
- Ventil Verlag uses SeaTable for many other processes, so that everyone in the team now works with it. Training was not necessary, as SeaTable can be used intuitively.
