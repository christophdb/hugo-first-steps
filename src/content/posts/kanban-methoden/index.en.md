## What is the Kanban method?

Kanban is a **process management method** for controlling work processes in order to avoid bottlenecks in the team and make optimum use of available resources. At its core, it is a form of visual project management centered around Kanban boards. A Kanban board represents the process sorted by columns, with each column representing a process step - such as "To Do", "In progress" and "Done". New tasks can be added from a waiting list or a backlog at any time. Each task is placed on the board as a card and moves from left to right from one column to the next until it is completed. The Kanban method is popular as a **pull method** in [task management]({{< relref "posts/aufgabenverwaltung" >}}) because it is flexible and easily adaptable and enables continuous process optimization without imposing a rigid construct.

### When was the Kanban system developed?

Kanban (composed of Japanese Kàn=card and Bàn=board) is originally a method from the manufacturing process and was developed in its current form at Toyota in 1947. The engineer Taiichi Ohno was looking for a method to improve productivity at Toyota, which was lower than at US companies. The Kanban model led to a rethink of the production process, as the company began to base production on actual demand rather than calculated planning. Paper cards on a board indicated that a part or product was needed and triggered the production process. This change enabled Toyota to drastically reduce inventories and at the same time increase its competitiveness through just-in-time production based on demand. In the early 2000s, Kanban was also introduced in software development and has since been widely used as a method of modern task and process management, particularly due to its very simple implementation.

### Is Kanban an agile method?

The Kanban method is one of the [agile project management methods]({{< relref "posts/20250318-agiles-projektmanagement" >}}) and promotes a transparent, situationally adaptable and efficient way of working. In software development, it is still one of the most widespread methods for agile working alongside Scrum. Kanban as a project management method is now used in almost every area, e.g. in marketing, product development or content creation.

### How does Kanban differ from Scrum?

Kanban is widely used as an agile project management framework, but it is only one of many agile methods. Let's take a look at the difference between **Kanban and Scrum**:

- A very **essential difference** compared to Scrum is that Kanban classically dispenses with fixed Kanban management roles or rituals, whereas Scrum provides for clearly defined roles and rituals.

- Kanban is a **continuous workflow** in which tasks can be transferred from the backlog to the ongoing process at any time, whereas Scrum uses time-limited sprints.

- With Kanban, **WIP limits** (work in progress) are set for parallel tasks, whereas with Scrum, work is planned per sprint.

- **Priorities can be flexibly adjusted** with Kanban, while Scrum does not allow any changes during a sprint.

- The **Kanban board shows the ongoing status,** the Scrum board is reset after each sprint.

- Kanban is a method for **promoting and visualizing** a flexible, continuous way of working, while Scrum follows a structured process with fixed time periods and clear responsibilities.

## How does the Kanban method work?

Kanban projects are based on the pull principle: team members take on tasks independently if they have the capacity to do so, instead of being assigned tasks from above. By visualizing all tasks in columns, workload and process progress are **transparent and traceable at all times.** Teams usually use a shared board on which tasks are assigned to individual team members. Of course, an employee can still take more tasks from the backlog than they can realistically work on. To avoid this, the maximum number of work steps in progress at any one time is limited by the WIP limit. This allows team and project managers to **identify bottlenecks and resource conflicts** more quickly and **optimize their processes accordingly.**

## What are the 4 Kanban principles?

If you are thinking about introducing the Kanban method in your company or team, you should understand the **four basic Kanban principles**:

\- Start with what you are already doing anyway

\- Agree on gradual, step-by-step changes

\- Consider existing processes, roles and responsibilities

\- Encourage initiative at all levels

### 1\. Start with what you are already doing

Every change in process or method also means that your team has to get used to something new. This rarely works straight away without friction. And you don't want to replace a process that is already working efficiently. This is where Kanban plays to one of its greatest strengths. Because it is essentially a process visualization, you can easily use the model **in addition to your existing processes and systems**. These explicitly have their value in the Kanban model. And if you use Kanban alongside your existing method, you will quickly recognize what works, where there are problems and where your processes can be improved.

### 2\. Agree on gradual, step-by-step changes

Quick, sweeping changes regularly cause resistance - and may not work in the end. As a flexible method, Kanban is designed to optimize **processes in small steps.** Only ever make individual adjustments and promote a feedback culture in order to achieve positive changes together.

### 3\. Take existing processes, roles and responsibilities into account

Kanban aims to improve existing workflows, not destroy them. Since Kanban does not require fixed responsibilities or Kanban management, you can introduce Kanban as an agile method without restructuring. Your team or company does not need any special prerequisites for Kanban.

### 4\. Encourage initiative at all levels

Kanban promotes the **exchange and personal responsibility** of employees. As a flexible method, it does not operate from the top down, but at and between all levels. Encourage your team to express opinions, contribute new ideas and take the initiative.

## What are the 6 Kanban practices?

The Kanban principles should be implemented smoothly without disrupting ongoing processes. In principle, all you need is a Kanban board and you can get started immediately. However, this alone does not guarantee an effective introduction of Kanban. In addition to the four Kanban principles, you should also know and apply these six central Kanban practices, also known as Kanban values:

### 1\. Visualize the workflow
Create cards on your Kanban board and move them from left to right through the columns. This gives you an overview of all tasks at all times and lets you see immediately if a task is stuck.

### 2\. Limit work in progress (WIP limits)
As an agile method, Kanban is based on the principle that tasks move quickly through the process instead of being "in progress" for weeks. Therefore, define a WIP limit and encourage your team to focus on a few important tasks instead of multitasking, where everything is done in parallel and at a slower pace. WIP limits are a key element of Kanban if you want your board to be more than just a [to-do list]({{< relref "posts/to-do-liste-online" >}}) structured in columns.

### 3\. Manage the flow of work
Kanban is about managing the workflow, not the employees. Therefore, regularly monitor progress and optimize the flow of tasks on your board.

### 4\. Make rules explicit
Make sure everyone involved understands the structure and purpose of the Kanban board and their own role in the process. Define and communicate rules and responsibilities.

### 5\. Build in feedback loops
If you want to use Kanban as an agile method to increase your productivity and become more efficient, feedback loops (in Kanban terminology: cadences) with your team are essential. Regularly discuss the status of tasks and any difficulties and ambiguities together. You can then derive further optimizations from this.

### 6\. Improve the process continuously
Kanban thrives on continuous improvement. Don't just collect feedback, use it. Feel free to test a combination of Kanban and other agile methods, such as Scrum.

## How are Kanban processes evaluated?

"You can't manage what you can't measure": The quote from economist Peter Drucker also applies to process management and Kanban methods. But which key figures can you use to evaluate the efficiency of your Kanban processes? These four are usually cited as **important metrics in connection with the Kanban method**:

\- **Throughput:** The number of items that pass through a process. The average throughput is calculated by dividing the average WIP by the average cycle time. The throughput of your team provides information about the productivity of your process.

\- **WIP:** the amount of tasks that are being processed. The WIP alone does not say anything, but must be considered in relation to the available working time in your team.

\- **Cycle duration:** describes the time your team needs for a task. A cycle begins as soon as someone is actively working on the task and ends when it is completed.

\- **Lead time:** describes the time it takes for a task to go through the board once - from its creation to its completion.

## How can you use the Kanban method?

Let's take a closer look at how you can apply the Kanban method. Following the first basic principle, select any existing workflow. In principle, you can also create your Kanban board on a whiteboard with sticky notes or make something in Excel. However, a digital board is more transparent and flexible, as most [work management systems]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/individual" >}}) already offer, in some cases free of charge. Follow these simple steps:

1\. Create an empty board: The board is the foundation you will work with later. Take your time to think about which work steps you want to map instead of flooding the board with your entire backlog. If you use a no-code solution such as SeaTable, you can use the Kanban plugin.

2\. Create columns to visualize your processes: Usually the individual columns represent different process steps or task statuses, but basically you are completely free here. To start with, it is best to work with ***Backlog, In progress, Paused*** and ***Completed.*** It is important that everyone working with the board has a common understanding of the structure.

3\. Create tasks: Now create tasks as Kanban cards. Don't get too detailed here, especially at the beginning. Most tools allow you to define additional subtasks, e.g. in SeaTable in the form of **checkboxes** within the task description.

4\. Define rules and automations: your board is ready for use. Now you just have to define the rules according to which tasks are taken from the backlog and distributed to the employees and at which points, for example, feedback or approvals must be obtained. SeaTable offers you an **integrated chat function and automated notifications**.

{{< warning headline="Workflow Management Tool SeaTable" text="The **no-code solution SeaTable** offers all the functions you need for modern workflow management and is as **intuitive as a spreadsheet.** Work together collaboratively in real time, create **automations** for lean processes, flexible dashboards for analyses and reports and **visualize your tasks** in Kanban views, calendars and timelines. With integrated notifications and the **comment function**, you can map all communication relating to a task in SeaTable. With the **Universal App Builder** you can create individual frontends. Start with the **free version**, which already offers you all the important functions, and scale up step by step. As a **GDPR-compliant** solution hosted exclusively on servers in Germany, SeaTable is particularly suitable for teams that value high data protection, **real-time collaboration,** integrated automation and **maximum flexibility and scalability**." />}}

## At a glance: What are the advantages of the Kanban method?

As you can see, Kanban is a very simple yet powerful method. With the Kanban model, teams become more flexible and faster and keep capacity and workload in balance. The most important advantages are, once again, summarized:

\- **Transparency:** You can see the current status of your tasks and your team's ongoing tasks at any time and act accordingly. You will achieve the greatest effect if you use a tool with real-time collaboration.

\- **Flexibility:** The Kanban framework is based on the principle of constant adjustments. On the one hand, Kanban allows you to react flexibly to external changes. At the same time, the Kanban model is so adaptable that you can optimize and change your processes.

\- **Efficiency:** The Kanban method promotes efficiency by allowing teams to focus on a small number of prioritized tasks. WIP limits prevent employees from getting bogged down in too many parallel tasks.

\- **Increased (customer) satisfaction:** Kanban is based on the idea that work resources are used where they are currently needed. As a method, it helps to use time and manpower efficiently, reduce wasted resources and focus on the essentials. Customer requirements can be implemented more quickly and employee satisfaction increases thanks to a clear focus.

**- **Simplicity:** A Kanban system is quickly implemented and does not require complex Kanban management roles or strict schedules.

## FAQ - Kanban method

{{< faq "Is Kanban only suitable for IT teams?" >}}

No, although Kanban is often used in software development, it can also be used in any other area for task management, e.g. you will regularly find Kanban in project management.

{{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Who is Kanban suitable for?" >}}

As there are no special requirements for Kanban, this method is generally suitable for companies and teams of different sizes, but also for individuals. Small teams, which often already work agile and independently, benefit from the structure and transparency offered by the Kanban model. Companies that do not yet use agile methods can use Kanban to introduce agile project management without interfering with existing processes and structures. However, companies with rigid structures and hierarchies will have problems implementing the basic Kanban principles and are less likely to use the Kanban system.
