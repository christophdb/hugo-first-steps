## What Klarna is

Klarna is a **Swedish financial services provider** that offers online payment services and solutions for processing **online purchases**. The company offers its customers a wide range of options, including **instant bank transfer**, **payment by installments** and **purchase on account**.

## How Klarna debts arise

## What happens if you have Klarna debts
