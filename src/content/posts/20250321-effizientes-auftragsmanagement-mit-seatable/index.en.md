## Advancing digital transformation

SeaTable can be used for a wide variety of purposes thanks to the flexibility of the system. Our customers are just as diverse, and their use cases are always exciting and inspiring for us - and sometimes surprising. One of our customers from China shared his use case with us, but did not want to be named. However, his story illustrates very well the various possibilities that SeaTable offers to make processes efficient and advance the digital transformation of companies and institutions.

## Growing complexity and lack of transparency in order management

Our customer offers the construction and maintenance of building installations. The rapidly growing company previously used Excel for order management. However, as the order volume grew, the employees increasingly reached the limits of the system and were looking for an [Excel alternative]({{< relref "pages/excel-alternative" >}}). Many processes were inefficient due to a lack of automation functions and had to be processed manually. The lack of true real-time collaboration meant that data was not always up-to-date and process statuses were not always transparent. In addition, there were increasing concerns about data security. A switch to a new, modern system became imperative.

**The company's main requirements included:**

1. Collaborative working: Employees should be able to work simultaneously with the same data and see changes in real time
1. Authorization management: Differentiated access rights for different positions
1. Automations: Simplification and automation of the order handover workflow
1. Data analysis: Visualization of important key figures via dashboards

## Universal no-code app as a solution

With the Universal App from SeaTable, a customized order management application was developed based on an intelligent SeaTable base with various tables, automations and no-code functions. This means that employees from different departments can now work together on orders in real time. If required, the app can be expanded using drag & drop without the need to employ programmers.

But that's not all: thanks to the automations and notification functions integrated into SeaTable, processes have been accelerated. Visually **prepared real-time data** enables fast analysis and decision-making processes. And all this without having to compromise on data security.

### Collaborative working and access authorizations

To ensure the protection of sensitive customer data, **role-based access rights** have been defined for page views and data processing. Thanks to the ability to set complex data filters, hide columns and differentiate between read-only and edit permissions, it is now ensured that customer data can only be viewed by the employees who really need it. Safety officers, for example, only see relevant orders and can report risks, while maintenance managers have more extensive access rights. Access and editing rights for the order management app are separated from access and editing rights for the underlying database.

### Automated workflows

Different tables have been created and linked together for different work phases. Automations ensure a seamless data flow between the tables so that every employee can access the latest data at any time. An example of such a workflow: When a new order is created, the assigned maintenance manager automatically receives a notification and all data records are synchronized.

### Data visualization

A very significant advance is the uncomplicated **creation of dashboards to monitor** and analyze profit margins, employee KPIs or project progress. The integrated Kanban and timeline plugin for Gantt charts proved to be particularly helpful for project schedules and progress.

## New growth impetus through more efficient workflows and transparency

The implementation of SeaTable has helped the company to modernize its order management and implement efficient, [digital workflows]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/individual" >}}). All employees can now work simultaneously in one system with up-to-date data without fear of data loss. Project managers and the management have access to current data visualizations at all times to evaluate relevant key business figures and project status. And all in one system. Order management in SeaTable has significantly accelerated work processes and decisions, while at the same time creating the basis for future growth.
