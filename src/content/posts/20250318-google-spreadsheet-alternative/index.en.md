## Why online spreadsheets like Google Spreadsheet are the new standard

The days when Excel was the undisputed leader in spreadsheets are over. Today, **online spreadsheets like Google Sheets** are shaking up the scene, offering all sorts of features that go beyond what classic desktop versions offer. These browser-based tools not only make data analysis and visualization easy, but also set new standards in terms of user-friendliness and real-time collaboration.

The new generation of Google Spreadsheet alternatives offers extended data formats and different application views. The triumph of online spreadsheets is therefore no coincidence - they offer functions that you will not want to do without in the future.

## Google Spreadsheet: a brief overview

Google Sheets is a **cloud-based tool** that serves as many users' first choice when it comes to spreadsheets. A key reason for this is that it is free and only requires a Google account - an account that most people already use anyway. In addition, a Google Spreadsheet offers the benefits of a modern online application: from **real-time collaboration to automatic saving**.

Another benefit of creating a spreadsheet with Google is the **seamless integration with other Google services** such as Google Docs, Google Drive and Google Analytics. This close integration allows you to exchange data and content between Google Docs and a Google Spreadsheet, for example. Creating a spreadsheet in Google Docs is only possible to a limited extent, as it was primarily developed for text documents.  
  
Google Sheets, on the other hand, offers significantly enhanced functionality for creating and editing tables - similar to Microsoft Excel. The ability to perform complex data analyses, use formulas and create charts makes Google Spreadsheets an indispensable tool for many companies.

## Tips for choosing the right tool

Are there any special extensions you need that are not available from every provider? Do you have concerns about data protection and therefore prefer a tool with a server location in a specific country or is this aspect less important to you?

Only when you have clarified these questions for yourself can you choose the right tool with confidence.

## 5 questions you should ask yourself when creating a spreadsheet

Before you create your spreadsheets for free, you should ask yourself the following five questions to make sure that your spreadsheet not only looks good, but also works efficiently:

1. **What information should be captured?** Clarity is key! Define exactly what data should end up in your spreadsheet. This saves time and prevents chaos.
1. **Who needs access to which spreadsheet?** Not everyone needs to see everything. Think about who needs access to which spreadsheet and set the release specifically.
1. **Can you simplify or automate processes?** If your data is alive and constantly being updated, consider how you can simplify or automate these processes.
1. **How do I keep track of all spreadsheet developments?** Versioning and change tracking are essential to stay up to date.
1. **Is there already a template that is useful for my project?** Why reinvent the wheel? Use freely available templates to get started quickly and efficiently.
