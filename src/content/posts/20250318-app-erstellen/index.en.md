## Advantages of app builders compared to conventional development methods

App builders offer numerous advantages over traditional development methods, which become clear on closer inspection. Where previously specialized development teams and high budgets were required, the use of free app builders opens up completely new possibilities.

- **Simple:** Lack of programming knowledge is no obstacle with app builders. These intuitive tools allow you to create, design and publish your own apps - without any technical expertise.
- **Fast:** Compared to traditional development, which often takes months, an free app builder saves you valuable time. There is no need for time-consuming programming, so the app is ready for launch within a few hours.
- **Affordable:** Individually developed apps can quickly incur high costs, often in the region of several thousand euros. App builders, on the other hand, are often significantly cheaper, which makes them particularly attractive for smaller budgets.
- **Independent:** Using an free app builder allows you to manage the app independently and flexibly. Changes can be made at any time without having to rely on external developers.
- **Low-risk:** The low financial investment significantly reduces the risk for you. In addition, App Builders are mature, well-tested systems that minimize potential sources of error that could occur in an individually programmed app.

## How a no-code app works

App builders work with predefined modules that you can put together individually and in a user-friendly way to realize the desired app. This allows you to create initial prototypes in a short space of time, which you can use to test new workflows. Rapid app creation also allows you to quickly gain insights. For example, whether the process is needed at all or can be optimized. In this way, you can make adjustments at any time without the need for external help.

**Note**

There are two types of apps - native apps and web apps. **Native apps** are specially developed for a specific operating system and are installed directly on the device, usually via an app store. **Web apps**, on the other hand, are accessed via the browser and do not require a download as they are accessible via a web address.

## App Builder in comparison

Creating your own app no longer has to be a complicated task. Thanks to modern free app builders, you can implement your ideas quickly and efficiently even without programming knowledge. However, the market is large and different tools offer different advantages and disadvantages. Three of these tools are presented in this section: Bubble, Adalo and Glide. Each of these tools offers specific functions, which we will examine in detail.

### Bubble

Bubble is a powerful, visually-oriented app creator aimed primarily at users who want to create sophisticated web applications. With its drag-and-drop editor, Bubble enables the design of user interfaces and the integration of databases and workflows without the need for programming skills. The flexibility that Bubble offers when creating web apps is particularly attractive. Users can implement extensive logics, workflows and data structures, which in many cases are sufficient for building complex systems.

#### Advantages

## 3 steps to your own app with SeaTable

If you want to create your own app but have previously shied away from complex programming code, SeaTable offers the ideal solution. This powerful tool is one of the modern no-code app builders and allows you to create web-based apps - free of charge and without having to write a single line of code. Your databases in SeaTable form a backend that users can access via an app. This allows you to control exactly who can see which data and how it is visualized.

So no longer ask yourself the question: "How can I create an app?" - here is the answer! The following step-by-step guide will show you how to develop your own app with SeaTable in no time at all.

### Step 1: Create a base

[First register for free]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}}) with SeaTable. After logging in, you will be taken to a clear user interface where you can create your first base. It is advisable to consider in advance how your app should be structured - be it a project management app, an inventory system or a to-do list. SeaTable offers various templates for this, which you can customize as required.

To use a ready-made template, click on the plus symbol in the "My bases" area and select the "Create base from template" option. In this example, we are using the template for workshops, which is already filled with sample data. The goal is to create a custom app that provides coaches with a central platform where they can access all important course information.

### Step 2: Add universal app

You can now add a universal app via the app button at the top right. After you have given the app a name, a new interface opens. This is still empty, but can now be customized to your needs.

![Screenshot: Create your first app with SeaTable](Step-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Add and configure pages

First of all, add a new page using the button on the left. You can create different types of pages in the app, such as a Kanban board, a web form or an individual page.

![Screenshot: selection of the page type in SeaTable](Step-3.jpg)

#### Calendar

To keep track of all appointments, you can create a calendar in the app. Select this page type and assign a page name. You must then select the corresponding table from which the data is to be taken. In this case, this is the "Workshop" table. Optionally, you can then select a suitable icon.

![Selection of page details in the App Builder in SeaTable](Step-3-Calendar-1.jpg)

There is currently no date information in the App Builder. To change this, click on the gear icon to open the page settings. Here you can select the Date column for the start and end date, after which the dates will appear in the calendar. To make it easier to distinguish the workshops, you can then differentiate the color of the calendar entries by sector.

![Screenshot: Calendar in SeaTable](Step-3-Calendar-2.jpg)

#### List of participants

So that the coaches of the courses can see directly which participants have already registered, we create a practical list of participants in the App Builder. To do this, simply add a new page, select the page type "Table" and specify "Participants" as the data source. All registrations are now visible. For more structure, the participants can be conveniently sorted by workshop using the "Group" tab.

![Participant list table in SeaTable](Step-3-Participants.jpg)

#### Individual page

A particularly exciting page type is the individual page. With this view, you can create user-friendly dashboards in the app that bundle all important information in a compact form. Once the page has been created, you can add elements such as images, statistics, containers or maps using drag-and-drop - just as you need them.

Let's start with statistics: Add a new field in the App Builder, which you can configure with a click. We opt for a simple bar chart and select the feedback table. Now it's time to select the data: We want to see how the workshops were rated. Select "Workshops" for the x-axis and "Summarize field" for the y-axis, which will display further options. For the summary field, take the rating of the workshops and leave the evaluation set to "Sum". This gives us a clear overview of which courses have received the best ratings.

![Insert bar chart in SeaTable App](Step-3-Dashboard-2.jpg)

In the next step, we want to access the calendar and the participant list from the individual page. To do this, add two cards that can be easily enlarged, reduced or moved to another location using the mouse. To make the cards work, we link them - one to the calendar, the other to the list of participants. Finally, you can add suitable images and voilà, your dashboard is ready to use! To make it even easier to access, you can move the page in the left-hand bar to the top so that it serves as the start page.

![Create Universal App in SeaTable](Step-3-Dashboard-3.jpg)

Now that you have mastered the basics of the Universal App, why not try out some page types yourself? For example, how about a page where coaches can see their feedback in more detail? Or a web form that can be used to submit new dates for courses, for example?
