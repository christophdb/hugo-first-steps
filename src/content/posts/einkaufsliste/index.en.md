But don't worry - a **digital shopping list/app** can be an effective remedy in such situations.

With the right organization, shopping is stress-free.

## Why shopping lists make sense

There are good reasons to keep lists in every area of life - and shopping is no exception. A carefully planned shopping list not only provides an organizational structure, but also has numerous benefits for your everyday life:

- **Save money**: If you plan exactly what you need before you go shopping and perhaps even draw up a [weekly plan]({{< relref "posts/meal-prep" >}}), you can save a lot of money. That way you no longer buy random items that catch your eye, but only what you really need.
- **Save time**: If you plan your shopping in advance with a shopping list, you will always have all the food you need for your favorite recipes at hand without forgetting anything. This saves you a lot of time, as double trips to the supermarket are a thing of the past.
- **Minimize food waste**: According to the [Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture](https://www.bmel.de/DE/themen/ernaehrung/lebensmittelverschwendung/studie-lebensmittelabfaelle-deutschland.html), every consumer throws away around 78 kilograms of food a year. Perhaps you also regularly throw away food because it is spoiled or past its best-before date. If you only buy what you really need in future, you will also have to throw away less. By planning your shopping wisely and [stocking up]({{< relref "posts/notvorrat-anlegen" >}}) properly, you not only help yourself, but also the environment.
