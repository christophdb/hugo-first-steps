## A modern system for an efficient process

Red Dot GmbH & Co. KG in Essen is an integral part of the international brand, product and communication design world. With the Red Dot Design Award, the company organizes one of the most internationally renowned design competitions and also operates the three Red Dot Design Museums in Essen, Singapore and Xiamen (China), which are among the most important museums for contemporary design. The award ceremonies for two of the three design competitions are now presented via SeaTable after the team was no longer able to map the complex processes with the existing solutions. Louisa Mücher, Digital Business Manager at the Red Dot Design Award, explains why Red Dot switched to SeaTable and what has changed as a result.

Before the introduction of SeaTable, the most important tool was a [desktop spreadsheet program]({{< relref "pages/excel-alternative" >}}). This solution was outdated, especially when it came to data management. Collaboration within the team was a real challenge, as collaborative work was not possible. The existing process proved to be particularly problematic when organizing the award ceremony for the Red Dot Award: Product Design, a major international event. The lack of opportunities for collaborative working proved difficult for smooth organization and last-minute changes.

## SeaTable perfectly fulfills the requirements

For Red Dot, it was clear that a different tool was needed that would also offer real-time collaboration in the data. However, an obvious [cloud solution]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-cloud" >}}) was ruled out due to the company's strict data protection regulations. A solution was therefore needed that supported collaborative working, met strict data protection requirements and could be hosted on-premise. At the time, Red Dot was already using Seafile, a sister product of SeaTable, as a file sharing tool. Louisa Mücher therefore received a recommendation from her IT service provider to take a look at SeaTable.

The user-friendliness, the high level of data protection and the unproblematic possibility of working together in one file were immediately convincing. The implementation process also went smoothly. With the support of the IT service provider, SeaTable was quickly rolled out in various areas of the company. As initial processes could be mapped using standard templates and the system is very user-friendly and intuitive, acceptance within the team was high.

## Versatile management tool

Today SeaTable is used as a versatile management tool. The main use case is still [event organization]({{< relref "templates/events/event-management" >}}). Guest lists and room allocation plans, personnel planning at events and even the gala schedule planned to the second are mapped in SeaTable. The ability to load audio files directly into a base has proven to be particularly useful here. This gives the director access to audio recordings at any time, for example of the pronunciation of the award winners' names.

Thanks to the API, order management and the dispatch of the Red Dot Design yearbooks are now also organized via SeaTable. Finally, SeaTable is also used as a CRM and [project management tool]({{< relref "pages/industry-solutions/project-management" >}}).

## Process management on a new level

Red Dot benefits from the ability to work collaboratively and map lean processes transparently. The employees managed the introduction and the first steps in SeaTable intuitively and were immediately convinced of the benefits. "Improved communication, collaborative and efficient working, more reliable and transparent data management overall, a high level of user-friendliness and a high standard of data protection: with SeaTable, Red Dot was able to successfully take internal processes to the next level." Siegfried Schneider, CMO, Red Dot GmbH & Co. KG
