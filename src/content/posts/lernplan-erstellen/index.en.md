Many pupils and students are caught in a maelstrom of procrastination and last-minute studying. Perhaps you too are putting off studying until you have to cram for hours on the last night before the exam in order to acquire the necessary knowledge by the skin of your teeth. But don't worry, there is a better way: create an effective **study plan**!

Whether it's your **A-level exams** or your **university exams**, a well-thought-out study plan can make the difference between success and failure. In this article, we show you in 7 simple steps how you can create a study plan to start the next exam phase with less stress.

## 1\. determine and visualize the learning objective

If you want to create a learning plan, you should first define a clear learning objective. Determine exactly what **content** you need to master and by what **deadline**. Make sure that your goals are **realistic** and the content is **relevant** so that you don't become stressed during the learning phase.

A clearly defined learning objective is the starting point for a successful learning plan.

In order to track your progress during the learning process, your goals should be **measurable**. A helpful method is to visualize your desired target performance in concrete terms, be it in the form of a grade or a specific level of knowledge. This gives you a clear idea of where you are heading and gives you additional motivation to achieve this goal.

## 2\. collect and structure learning material

Before you create a learning plan, it is essential to collect and structure all the learning material. Start by gaining a **comprehensive overview** of all relevant topics and **sorting out unimportant information**. Make a note of the sources for the important content, for example **textbooks**, **lecture slides**, **specialist articles** or your own **notes** from lessons.

When collecting learning materials, also consider their quality.

It is then important to systematically structure all the collected materials in order to maintain an overview. You can use a tabular structure according to **topic blocks** or **mind maps** to avoid forgetting any relevant content.

## 3\. divide into smaller learning units and prioritize

Now that you have identified all the relevant topics for the exam, it is time to break them down into **smaller learning packages**. This will allow you to grasp and process the learning material more efficiently. By breaking it down into manageable units, you prevent yourself from feeling overwhelmed by the wealth of material and losing focus.

Smaller units make it easier to process and understand.

In addition, it is advisable to assess the **level of difficulty** of the individual learning units and prioritize them accordingly. In this way, you can effectively focus your time and energy on those topics that are the most challenging or particularly relevant to the exam. A clear **ranking** of the learning content will help you to prioritize and ensure that you make the best use of your limited resources.

## 4\. find the right learning method

While you are creating your learning plan, it is also worth taking a look at different learning methods and identifying the one that **suits** you best. Learning methods are strategies that aim to maximize learning success by promoting the consolidation of knowledge. Given the variety of methods available, it is important to choose those that best suit your **individual needs** and possibly combine different methods.

![A hand turns the page of a book](images/book-6957870_1280-711x474.jpg)

It is helpful to try out different learning methods.

To find the right learning method, you should first consider your own learning preferences and styles. You may prefer visual aids such as **educational videos** and **graphics**, or you may learn better through **active listening** and **discussion**. Experiment with different methods to find out which are most effective for you.

Some proven learning methods you can consider are:

### The Loci Method

With the [loci method](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loci-Methode), you link information to places that you know well. Imagine you are learning a list of vocabulary words. You associate each word with a place in your home. When you want to repeat the vocabulary later, you mentally walk through your house and remember the words that you have associated with certain places.

### The Pareto principle

The [Pareto Principle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paretoprinzip) states that you can achieve about 80 percent of learning success by focusing on the most important 20 percent of the material. For example, you may find that learning the most important concepts or formulas in a subject gives you the most benefit, while the rest of the material is less crucial. By focusing on the essentials, you can use your study time more efficiently and achieve better results. This principle can already be useful while you are creating your study plan.

### The Leitner system

With the [Leitner system](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernkartei), you organize index cards into different stacks or trays, depending on how well you have mastered the information on them. Let's assume you have a box with 5 compartments that you use to go through your flashcards every day. If you answer a card correctly, it moves forward one compartment until it reaches the successfully learned compartment. If you answer it incorrectly, it goes back to the first compartment. In this way, you concentrate more on the more difficult cards, while you have to repeat the easier ones less often.

### The Pomodoro technique

The [Pomodoro technique](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro-Technik) consists of dividing work into intervals of around 25 minutes, known as "pomodoros", followed by short breaks. For example, you work hard on a task for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer break of around 15 to 30 minutes. This method helps to maintain concentration and reduce fatigue.

### The mnemonics

[Mnemonics](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemotechnik) are methods that help you to remember information better by linking it to easy-to-remember images, stories or structures. For example, you can make up a story to remember a list of dates or use an acronym to memorize a sequence of information.

## 5\. estimate effort and create schedule

Now that you have structured your learning content, it is time to create a detailed schedule for your learning sessions. This plan will help you to achieve your learning goals efficiently and maintain a healthy balance between **learning**, **everyday life** and **free time**.

A detailed schedule helps to organize the learning process and meet deadlines.

When creating your schedule, you should consider several important aspects. Firstly, it is important to plan for **buffers** and **deadlines**. Buffer times allow you to cope better with unforeseen events or additional workloads without throwing your study plan off balance. Clear deadlines help you to stay focused and not get lost.

Use your calendar to plan not only your study times, but also your everyday commitments and leisure activities. This will help you create a balanced schedule that offers enough space for rest and relaxation. Don't forget to plan in **regular study breaks**. These can increase efficiency and prevent fatigue.

Stay realistic and set yourself achievable goals. Adjust your learning plan if necessary to ensure that you can achieve your learning goals.

## 6\. motivation

The learning phase is coming up and you can't overcome your reluctance? Even if it's difficult, try to get excited about the topics and stick to your study plan to avoid time pressure and a guilty conscience.

An important aspect of motivation is the **personal relevance** of the learning material. Your brain is more likely to store information in your long-term memory if you perceive it as meaningful and interesting. Enjoying learning can therefore work wonders! Even if you are not necessarily enthusiastic about a subject like percentages, you should at least realize that you will need it in your life. This will not only make learning more efficient, but also more fulfilling.

It is also beneficial to **link** the information with existing knowledge. Therefore, try to establish a connection between the learning material and your previous knowledge. Practice makes perfect: by **applying** abstract learning content using concrete examples, you can consolidate your knowledge.

![Create a learning plan: Sign on the desk with the inscription "You got this"](images/pexels-prateekkatyal-2740956-711x474.jpg)

Motivation can be influenced by various factors.

If you keep your learning goals in mind, you can be sure that you are on the right track and getting closer to success. Reward yourself for your efforts, be it with a **little time out**, a special **treat** or another goodie. Relaxing activities such as **sports**, **cultural activities** or **socializing** are an important balance to your daily learning routine in order to maintain your mental health.

## 7\. reflection

Reflection is a crucial step in the learning process as it allows you to assess your progress, rethink your learning plan and make **adjustments** where necessary. Record your progress by regularly reviewing your level of knowledge. Consider whether you can still achieve the goals you have set yourself or whether a course correction is necessary. Perhaps your learning methods or goals have changed during the learning process - and it is important to acknowledge reality and adjust your learning plan accordingly.

![Create a learning plan: Face reflected in a piece of glass](images/vince-fleming-Vmr8bGURExo-unsplash-711x474.jpg)

Reflection on the learning plan enables continuous improvement of learning.

Pay attention to deviations from your original study plan and analyze the reasons for them. You may have difficulty sticking to your schedule or be easily distracted. Identify possible stumbling blocks and consider how you can overcome them, be it through **more discipline**, **better time management techniques** or **reducing distractions**.
