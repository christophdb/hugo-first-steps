## Digital solutions for modern property management

Property management is a multifaceted task that goes far beyond simply maintaining buildings. Whether it's a municipal housing association or the designation of a commercial area - as a property manager, you ensure that operations run smoothly. From buying and selling to letting and managing land and properties: every property brings its own challenges.

In the public sector in particular, the **digitalization of property management** generates a lot of data, which means that data protection, data integration and process optimization play a key role. In this article, we will show you what is important in property management and how you can effectively manage your buildings and properties digitally so that you can still keep an overview.

## What are properties?

In legal terminology, the term "real estate" is defined as **immovable tangible property**, which essentially means a plot of land. But what exactly does real estate mean?

In contrast to the purely legal understanding of the term property, real estate refers to **more than just the mere area of land**. It also includes **all permanent structures** located on it, such as residential buildings, commercial buildings, factories or other structures. By definition, real estate therefore goes beyond the mere land that the property represents.

**Note**: In practice, property and land are often used interchangeably, but the exact distinction is particularly important in legal or real estate contexts.

## The different types of real estate

There are various types of real estate, which differ mainly in their use. Here is an overview of the common types in property management:

- **Commercial properties**: These include hotels, restaurants or industrial parks used for business purposes.
- **Residential properties**: This includes residential properties such as single-family homes or apartment buildings that are entirely privately occupied.
- **Mixed-use properties**: These properties serve both commercial and residential purposes, such as townhouses that have a store or medical practice on the first floor and apartments on the upper floors.
- **Special-purpose properties** are properties with a special purpose that lies outside the usual residential or commercial use, such as for tourist, medical or leisure-related services.

## Legal requirements in property management

There are various legal requirements that must be observed in property management. If you do not comply with them, you may face consequences - from fines and claims for damages to building freezes and rent reductions. Three important areas of law that you should be aware of are tenancy law, construction law and data protection law:

### Tenancy law

If your properties are rented out, compliance with the legal provisions of tenancy law is essential. This starts with legally compliant tenancy agreements, which should contain clear regulations on rent, ancillary costs and deposits. Compliance with regional rent brakes is also of great importance in order to avoid getting into legal difficulties. Other important aspects include legally correct notice periods and dealing with rental defects, where your tenants may be entitled to rent reductions in the worst case scenario.

### Building law

If you are planning structural changes to your property, building law is the decisive factor. It is essential to obtain the necessary building permits, especially for new buildings or major conversions. Respectful interaction with neighboring properties is also regulated - strict regulations apply here regarding distance areas and common rights and obligations. In addition, you should always take monument protection into account when converting older buildings, as this places special requirements on renovations.

### Data protection

An important area of property management that is often not immediately obvious is data protection. Particularly in the [public sector](https://seatable.com/digitale-verwaltung/) or in larger administrative units, you must manage tenant and owner data in compliance with the GDPR. This means that you may only collect and securely store personal data with consent. Effective protection against unauthorized access to this data is essential to avoid both legal consequences and loss of trust.

## When you can outsource property management to external parties

Property management can be very complex and resource-intensive, especially when it comes to larger real estate portfolios or special requirements. In some cases, it is worth handing over this task to external experts. This is especially true **when specific expertise is required**, such as compliance with building regulations. An external administrator can not only minimize legal risks for you, but also ensure more efficient management. This is particularly relevant **when there is not enough staff available internally** or your team needs to focus on other tasks.

Outsourcing also often offers the **benefit of 24/7 emergency management** that can respond quickly and professionally to problems - an important component to minimize downtime or disruption. In addition, external managers often have **a broad network of service providers**, which makes it easier for you to access reliable tradespeople and specialized professionals.

## Property management and public service

Property management in the public sector presents a particular challenge, bringing with it both responsibility and enormous opportunity. Public bodies often manage a wide range of sites and properties - from historic buildings to marketplaces and playgrounds to modern administrative complexes. This diversity requires well thought-out and efficient management that goes far beyond mere maintenance.

Responsibility generally lies with the local authority property offices. These offices are responsible for the purchase, sale and letting of municipal properties. They manage and maintain properties that are important both for public purposes and for citizens. Property management in the public sector is faced with the task of combining economic efficiency with the common good.

Unlike private property managers, they must not only work cost-effectively**, but also take social interests into account**. Decision-making processes, such as the sale or conversion of properties, are often lengthy as they are subject to political approval procedures. Added to this is the obligation of transparency, as every decision in the public interest must be comprehensible. These factors make management more difficult and significantly more complex than in the private sector.

## What tasks are involved in property management

The tasks of a property manager are varied and require both technical and commercial know-how. It is the link between owners, tenants, service providers and authorities. Their aim is to ensure the smooth operation of properties and maintain their value in the long term. But what are the specific tasks involved in property management?

- **Acquisition, sale and management**: In municipal property management companies in particular, all aspects of the purchase and sale of developed and undeveloped properties are part of the management process. This also includes the letting and leasing of communal areas, for example for events such as festivals and markets.
- **Care and maintenance**: One of the central tasks of property management is the technical management of properties. This primarily involves maintaining the structural condition of the buildings and ensuring that all technical systems, such as heating or fire protection equipment, function perfectly.
- **Keeping an eye on finances**: The commercial side of property management is just as important as the technical side. This involves all the financial aspects associated with the property. This includes rental management, accounting and the preparation of utility bills.
- **Contracts and legal security**: A property management company also takes care of legal matters. It draws up and reviews tenancy agreements, ensures compliance with them and mediates between tenants and owners in the event of a dispute. The management also ensures that the property meets all legal requirements, such as fire safety regulations.
- **Avoid vacancies**: Management plays an important role when it comes to avoiding vacancies and marketing properties optimally. It organizes viewings, prepares exposés and negotiates rental agreements. Market analysis is also part of this: Management monitors current rental prices and adjusts conditions as necessary to ensure that the property remains competitive.
- **Sustainability and energy efficiency**: Modern property management places increasing emphasis on environmental aspects and energy efficiency. It promotes measures that lower the property's energy consumption in the long term and reduce its ecological footprint. For example, the management can organize the installation of solar panels on the roof of the property or encourage the replacement of old heating systems with more energy-efficient models.
