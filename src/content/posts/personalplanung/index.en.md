Imagine a company is planning to launch a new product on the market, but lacks the skilled staff for development, production or marketing. The success of the project is jeopardized before it has really begun. This is where workforce planning comes into play - a strategic tool that ensures you always have the **right people with the right skills** in place.

## What is workforce planning?

Personnel planning is a central component of strategic personnel policy and a key task within human resources management. It aims to determine the **future personnel requirements of a company and to cover these requirements with suitable measures**. Not only the quantitative but also the qualitative requirements for employees are taken into account. HR planning helps to achieve corporate goals efficiently and remain competitive in the long term.

## Everything that is part of personnel planning

Personnel planning is not just about managing employees, but also about a strategic orientation that guarantees long-term success. But what are the tasks and objectives of personnel planning? Let's take a closer look at examples from the various sub-areas.

- **Staff planning:** The first step towards successful staff planning is to take stock. Here you determine how many employees are currently working in your company, what qualifications they have and where there may be gaps.
- **Personnel requirements planning:** The aim here is to determine how many employees with which qualifications you will need in the future. Seasonal fluctuations, projects and long-term company goals play a decisive role here.
- **Staff planning:** Staff planning ensures that your employees are in the right place at the right time. An efficient duty roster that plans staff deployment is the be-all and end-all.
- **Personnel development:** Your employees are your most important asset. With targeted further training and development measures, you can promote talent, retain skilled workers in your company and secure your long-term competitiveness.
- **Recruitment:** Recruitment is all about recruiting new employees. Today, it is no longer enough to simply place a job advertisement. You have to actively search and inspire potential candidates.
- **Staff release planning:** It is not always possible to avoid staff overcapacity. Whether seasonal fluctuations, restructuring or economic crises - sometimes redundancies are unavoidable. Professional redundancy planning ensures that these processes are fair and transparent.
- **Personnel costs:** No personnel planning works without keeping an eye on costs. It is important to find a healthy balance between investing in employees and the profitability of the company.

## The dimensions of personnel planning

There are fundamentally different models in personnel planning. Whether operational and strategic or quantitative and qualitative planning approaches - they enable companies to meet requirements and master challenges.

![Strategic planning creates security](langfristige-ziele-personal.jpg)

The difference between operational and strategic HR planning lies primarily in the time horizon and focus. Strategic HR planning is aimed at long-term goals, usually with a planning horizon of 5 to 10 years. It is shaped by external factors such as market trends, technological developments and the competitive environment. Its task is to proactively tackle future challenges and make holistic decisions that will strengthen the company in the long term.

In contrast, **operational HR planning focuses on short-term periods** of up to one year. Here, the focus is on specific individual problems and internal requirements, such as ensuring staffing for ongoing projects or reacting to bottlenecks at short notice. Operational planning requires measures that can be implemented quickly without tying up long-term resources.

Quantitative and qualitative personnel planning differ in their objectives. Quantitative personnel planning is concerned with the number of employees and attempts to strike a balance between excess capacity and staff shortages. It answers the question of whether there is enough staff to cover demand or whether recruitment or downsizing is necessary.

Qualitative personnel planning, on the other hand, focuses on the skills and competencies of employees. Its aim is to identify future know-how requirements, build them up in a targeted manner and reduce outdated knowledge where necessary. It lays the foundation for the company to remain competitive in a dynamic environment by aligning the development of the workforce with strategic goals.

## How to calculate your personnel requirements

Workforce planning is not a matter of gut feeling - it is based on clear figures and formulas. To calculate the right staffing requirements and ensure you meet your targets, six simple calculations are key. Here we show you how to use these formulas to make your workforce planning effective and accurate.

![Keep an eye on personnel costs](personal-berechnen.jpg)

### 1 Determining deployment requirements

The first step is to calculate the resource requirements. This indicates how much work needs to be done in total and how many employees you need to complete this work. This means that you divide the total time required by the number of working hours that an employee can perform on average.

`Resource requirement = total workload / working hours per employee`

{{< warning headline="Note" text="Time recording and personnel planning should go hand in hand, as precise recording of working hours forms the basis for forward-looking and effective planning. Only if you have up-to-date data on the time required can you correctly estimate the total workload." />}}

### 2. calculate distribution time factor

Next, you need to determine the distribution time factor in order to calculate the reserve requirement. The distribution time factor takes into account all absences such as vacation, illness or other delays in the work process. Here you add up all absences (e.g. due to illness, vacation or public holidays) and divide them by the actual working days (the actual working days without absences). The result shows what percentage of working time is lost due to absences.

`Distribution time factor (%) = absences / actual working days x 100`

### 3. calculate reserve requirement

The reserve requirement ensures that enough employees are available to cope with the workload even in the event of absences. It is calculated by multiplying the deployment requirement by the distribution time factor:

`Reserve requirement = deployment requirement x distribution time factor`

### 4. calculate gross personnel requirements

You now have all the important values for the gross personnel requirement. This is the sum of deployment requirements and reserve requirements. It shows how many employees are needed in total to cover the workload and the reserve for absences.

`Gross personnel requirements = deployment requirements + reserve requirements`

### 5. calculate updated headcount

In the next step, you determine the updated headcount, which shows how many employees are currently in the company after you have taken into account additions and departures. In doing so, you calculate all new additions (e.g. through hiring or returning from parental leave) and all departures (e.g. through dismissals or retirement).

`Updated headcount = current headcount + fixed additions - expected departures`

### 6. calculate net personnel requirements

Finally, you calculate the net personnel requirement, which tells you how many employees you still need to hire or lay off in order to achieve the ideal headcount.

`Net personnel requirements = gross personnel requirements - updated headcount`

{{< warning headline="Note" text="A positive result means that you need to hire additional employees (staff shortage). A negative value means that you can reduce staff (overstaffing)." />}}

## The right way to deal with overstaffing

There are also situations in personnel planning that you should approach with particular sensitivity and responsibility. One of these situations occurs when you have too many staff, i.e. there is an overstaffing situation. There are no easy solutions, but by being transparent and open, you can show that you have your employees' best interests at heart. Dismissals should always be the last resort - before that, there are numerous approaches you can take to find a fair and sustainable solution.

![Enable flexibility through part-time work](personalueberdeckung.jpg)

Consider whether more flexible part-time models can help to better manage capacities. Offer early retirement if this could be an option for certain employees. Sabbaticals are also a way of providing temporary relief while at the same time sending valuable signals of appreciation.

A review and reallocation of tasks or internal transfers can also help to reduce staff surpluses. It is important that you communicate these measures transparently and involve your employees. An open attitude strengthens trust and shows that you are aware of your responsibility.

If redundancies are unavoidable, treat them with the utmost care. Support those affected with outplacement programmes, for example, to make the transition to a new professional future easier for them.

## How to respond successfully to staff shortages

Staff shortages are a challenge in personnel planning that requires strategic action and flexibility. A key solution lies in the targeted recruitment of new talent. Modern recruiting and optimised applicant management enable you to attract the best specialists for your company. It can be crucial to use new channels such as social media or specialised platforms and to establish an attractive employer brand that clearly communicates your strengths.

![Start recruiting early enough](personalunterdeckung.jpg)

But what if the search for new employees proves difficult? Even then, there are ways to overcome staff shortages. Clever prioritization of your projects can provide great short-term relief: Focus on central tasks that create direct added value and temporarily suspend less urgent projects.

Automating processes is another way of conserving resources. Digital tools can take over repetitive tasks and free up valuable capacity. This not only helps you in acute bottleneck situations, but also boosts your company's efficiency in the long term.

Your existing employees can also be part of the solution. With further training and internal flexibility, skills can be built up in a targeted manner and gaps closed. This measure not only promotes cooperation, but also strengthens employee loyalty to your company.

Temporary staff or freelancers can also be brought in for quick and flexible support. They offer short-term relief and enable you to react flexibly to acute staff shortages.

## How to avoid high staff turnover

![Determine personnel requirements in good time](zufriedene-mitarbeiterin.jpg)

High staff turnover can be costly for companies and jeopardize team cohesion, productivity and long-term success. This is particularly problematic when it comes to personnel planning, as frequent changes make long-term planning more difficult and require additional resources for recruitment and training. However, there are numerous measures that companies can take to avoid staff turnover. Below you will find some valuable approaches that help to strengthen employee retention and promote long-term, stable cooperation.

- **Pay for success:** Reward good performance to encourage recognition and motivation.
- **Responsibilities:** Clear allocation of roles creates security and orientation.
- **Pleasant working environment:** A well-designed workplace increases well-being and productivity.
- **Scheduling flexibility:** Flexible working hours or locations enable a better work-life balance.
- **Skills development:** Provide development opportunities to develop the potential of your employees.
- **Team building:** Strengthen cohesion through joint activities and an open corporate culture.
- **Personal responsibility:** Hand over responsibility and trust your employees to make decisions independently.
- **Positive feedback:** Regular recognition and praise for good work motivate and strengthen loyalty.
