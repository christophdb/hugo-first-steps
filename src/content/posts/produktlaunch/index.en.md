Once you have successfully completed the product development process, nothing stands in the way of a product launch.

While the development process is already very well structured in most companies, too little attention is usually paid to the product launch process. Have you really completed all the necessary steps and forgotten nothing? With our [template]({{< relref "templates/software-development/product-launch" >}}) and these [5 tips](https://www.pressesprecher.com/nachrichten/fuenf-tipps-fuer-einen-gelungenen-produkt-launch-9837), nothing stands in the way of a successful product launch!

## Structure of our product launch template

Our product launch template consists of three linked tables. Let's take a closer look at them:

### Features table

In the first table you can enter the individual features of your product and check their status. Our template deals with software as an example, but the template can of course be applied to any other type of product. After all, every product has individual components and features that need to be checked. In addition to the status, you can assign the individual features to a product category and add a description of the feature. In addition, they can enter the date of the test and launch of each individual feature. The dates can be clearly displayed with our calendar plugin. Depending on how extensively you promote the launch of the new features, there are several columns at the end of the table for checking planned entries of the individual channels. For example, for mails, blogposts, related articles and advertisements. The last two columns help with your project prioritisation. Here you can enter the complexity and value of the respective feature. Thanks to the different views that SeaTable offers, you can also filter and group exactly according to these criteria, giving you an even better overview of upcoming tasks.

### Table Product Topics

In the Product Topics table you can assign the individual features of your product to a product category. This helps you to structure your product and, especially in the case of software products, shows how many features are available in which area.

### Table Newsletter

The Newsletter table is specifically for the email marketing channel. New features need to be communicated. You can enter and read in which email you need to discuss which new features.

## With SeaTable the product launch is guaranteed to succeed

With our [product launch template]({{< relref "templates/software-development/product-launch" >}}), you always keep track of your to-dos before the final product launch.
