To achieve measurable success on social media platforms, you need to continuously publish new content. And often several times a week for different channels, such as LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X or YouTube. You need to **post interesting and entertaining content on time**. A **social media editorial plan** will help you with this. Read this article to find out how to develop a successful social media strategy with a social media plan.

## Why you need a social media editorial plan

### 1\. maintain an overview

A social media plan allows you to keep **track of your social media channels**. More specifically, you can use a social media editorial plan to record **who, what, when and where you should post**. If you use a central tool for social media posts, you can work more efficiently with your colleagues, as everyone in the team can always see the current status. This **makes it easier for you to distribute tasks** and still adhere to your corporate design guidelines to create social media posts that look consistent.

### 2\. record ideas

The next advantage of a content plan for social media is that you can **collect unlimited ideas**. If an idea for a social media post comes to fruition, you can simply roll it out to your individual channels and **create customized content**. This means you always have posts in the pipeline in case you run out of creativity when creating new content. After all, there's nothing worse than having to produce creative content under time pressure and then not having any good ideas.

### 3\. plan appointments

It should be possible to display the editorial plan in a calendar. This allows you to plan well in advance **on which dates and at what intervals you want to post**. For example, make a note of important public holidays or events for which you want to publish content in line with the topic. Anyone who regularly produces content for social media channels knows how **important a well-structured editorial plan** is **for smooth workflows**.

### 4\. systematically organize content

A social media plan also allows you to create connections between posts. For example, you can come up with **your own categories and formats** for which you regularly publish content. When developing your social media strategy, define the extent to which the posts should be similar or independent of each other. Think about **which messages you want your followers to internalize**, how you can best convey them and whether they match the goals you have set in your marketing plan.

### 5\. analysis and strategy

An editorial plan for social media also helps you to **analyze past posts**. Whether impressions, clicks, likes or comments: Which content performed particularly well on which of your channels? How can you tailor your content even better to your target groups in future? No matter which social media strategy you pursue: A self-created social media editorial plan will help you with planning, implementation and evaluation.

## What a social media editorial plan should cover

When you create your social media editorial plan, it's all about **mapping and simplifying** the **workflow of your content creation team**. Tasks within the editorial process can include:

1. Research and brainstorming
2. Photo shoot or video shoot
3. Post-production and editing
4. Text creation
5. Layout design
6. Editing and approval
7. Publication

Depending on the size of your content creation team, you can take on the tasks yourself or delegate them to specialists (copywriters, concept developers, graphic designers, editors).

- Topics and ideas
- Tasks and responsible team members
- Uploaded files (text/image/video)
- Your social media channels and content formats
- Processing status
- Deadlines for drafts and publication dates

A well-thought-out content plan helps to build a consistent brand identity, engage the target group and increase reach. Instagram content planning is more than just posting pretty pictures.
