## The triumph of content marketing

Everyone knows classic advertising, as it is a constant companion in our everyday lives. We find it in the form of television or radio commercials, classic outdoor advertising or as advertisements in journals and magazines. In most cases, advertising is intended to attract the attention of the potential customer and involuntarily interrupt him in his actual activity. No wonder, then, that the negatively connoted term "interruption marketing" is also common for this type of marketing.

A much better approach would be if the customer consumes the advertising voluntarily, even explicitly searches for it and engages with the company. But how does that work? How does a company get the attention of its future customers?

This is exactly where the full-service agency [Content Marketing Star](https://content-marketing-star.de) comes in. The team of experts understands like no other how to deliver valuable, relevant and consistent content to customers on all channels. The agency delivers content for its own corporate blog, social media channels or even its own corporate podcast based on relevant keywords and also understands how to publish the content in a search engine optimized way and make it accessible to the target group.

The challenge is to offer suitable content that the customer does not perceive as advertising but as relevant information. Therefore, the content focuses on the customer's benefit and not on contentless advertising messages that would then have to be advertised expensively. This way, the customer finds the company all by himself.

## Insight into the Content Marketing Star workflow

In order to cause the customer to approach your content on their own, you need to know what interests them. Content marketing star begins with the definition of several [buyer personas](https://blog.hubspot.de/marketing/was-ist-der-unterschied-zwischen-zielgruppen-und-buyer-personas). A buyer persona is a fictional character that represents a potential customer of the company. Next, you start researching which keywords this person might use in their daily browsing history, while also paying attention to which keywords are generally relevant and often searched for. The so-called "keyword research", which can easily include several hundred search terms, is the basic prerequisite for any successful content strategy.

Content Marketing Star used Excel for this keyword research in the past. However, coordinating with the client on the keywords to ultimately focus on proved difficult with Excel. In addition, the marketing agency wanted to be able to immediately create a link between the keyword and the corresponding planned article based on the keywords selected with the customer. This would allow them to move seamlessly into the editorial plan and start creating the actual content. This was not possible with Excel and one had to use multiple files for the entire planning. There was no overall view of the extensive process, which included coordination with the client as well as agency-led coordination with the authors.

With SeaTable, my team and I have full control over a client's entire content marketing strategy. The sharing capabilities allow us to coordinate directly with the client and keep them informed of the current status at all times.

## SeaTable helps to structure the process and keep the overview

SeaTable helps the content marketing agency to map the entire process of keyword research and related content creation. For each client, the agency creates a separate base with multiple spreadsheets.

First of all, personas can be created here that reflect the company's potential customers. Based on these personas, the keyword research begins, which also gets its own spreadsheet. The relevant keywords are listed and can be shared directly with the customer via the sharing functions. This makes it easy for the agency to agree on focus keywords in collaboration with the client.

Then the actual content creation begins. Based on the keywords, articles for company blogs and podcasts are created. SeaTable offers the possibility to link individual entries and spreadsheets with each other. The planned article is therefore directly linked to the corresponding keyword and ends up in the spreadsheet of the editorial plan.

In the editorial plan, there is space for the headline of the article, the publication date, the commissioned author, notes and a status line. It is not uncommon for the writing of articles to be outsourced to freelancers. SeaTable facilitates communication here, as the editorial plan also provides space for briefings, the author's final text, approvals, article images, accompanying texts for all social media channels and comments from the client side. This makes communication among the relevant parties extremely easy and keeps everyone on the same page.

Thanks to the flexible structure of SeaTable, the approach can be customized depending on the client. Thus, SeaTable has become an important tool for the marketing agency Content Marketing Star.

With SeaTable we keep track of the respective keywords and the content strategy of our clients.
