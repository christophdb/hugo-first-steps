SeaTable is a great tool that can help you capture, structure and work with data in many ways. So it doesn't surprise us to keep hearing about people using SeaTable in new and interesting ways to organize themselves, their lives and their work. An artist from India told us that he uses SeaTable to manage all of his work including press relations, client list, commissioned work and a chronological overview of his work, giving him flexibility and freedom to work. Or a caf√© owner from Berlin who uses SeaTable to be able to register the addresses of her guests for Corona tracking.

We love being surprised by these kinds of stories and experiences, so we're excited to offer tons of [SeaTable integrations]({{< relref "help/integrationen" >}}) that give our users countless ways to be even more creative or productive. Our users can now connect SeaTable to over 4,000 different services and apps, including popular services like Slack, Twitter, all Google Apps, Mailchimp, GitHub, and many more.

This is made possible by the Zapier automation service, which enables data or information to be exchanged between the various services on an event-based basis. Zapier is easy to use and requires no programming knowledge. One defines the desired process by specifying a trigger and a follow-up action. In many cases, this can save time or increase productivity. With the large number of apps supported, the possibilities are literally endless. Receive an email notification when a certain event occurs, automatically transfer a new entry to another system, or automatically archive new information in SeaTable.
