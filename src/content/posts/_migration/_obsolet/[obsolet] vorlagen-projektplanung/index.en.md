**Project planning****templates** make it possible to start planning and implementing a project immediately. Gantt charts, Kanban boards or smart lists are used to manage project activities, deadlines, budgets and more. Below you will find various templates including sample data for creating your project plan.

## What is a project plan?

A project plan contains all the overviews and documents you need to start your project. These can be, for example, the [project structure plan](https://seatable.io/en/projektstrukturplan-vorlage/), a schedule, a cost plan and a resource plan. Documents on the [quality and risk management of](https://seatable.io/en/swot-analyse-template/) the project are also conceivable.

The project plan is a central place where you can track every step of the project. It enables easier communication between stakeholders and sets out the timing, scope and [costs of the project](https://seatable.io/en/budgetplanung-vorlage/).

The representation can take place in lists. In addition, the Gantt chart or a Kanban board are often used. A Gantt chart is a method from [project management](https://seatable.io/en/projektmanagement/) to depict tasks and events in horizontal bars with start and end dates. The Kanban board, on the other hand, is about working through tasks as to-do cards in interactive lists. The following are examples of templates for a project plan for both.

## When does it make sense to use it in project planning?

The use of a project plan is useful for every project, as it simplifies communication, ensures transparency and keeps all project participants on the same level. At the same time, [time management](https://seatable.io/en/arbeitszeiterfassung-in-excel/) and better organisation of project activities become possible.

During the initiation and planning of the project, the project plan should already be created. It remains flexible with the implementation of the project and can be adapted at any time. The project plan initially forms the basis for decisions in the planning phase. For example, it is necessary to identify the scope of certain tasks or overlapping activities, costs and risks. Later, the project plan becomes an irreplaceable tool in the implementation of a project. Here it is primarily a matter of organisation, distribution of tasks and transparency.

Read below how to successfully use templates for a project plan with Excel or a digital tool like SeaTable.
