Have you always wanted to try a parachute jump from an airplane? Have you dreamed of diving on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia since you were a child? Or would you like to spend a night in an igloo in Norway? Then put these destinations on your bucket list!

Our dreams and aspirations are what drive us and inspire us to embark on unforgettable adventures. But all too often they are postponed or neglected as we get caught up in the daily grind. A bucket list can help you capture your dreams and remind you to make them a reality. After all, it is experiences that enrich our lives and fill us with memories that will last a lifetime.

Whether adventurous thrills or breathtaking nature: our dreams are different.

## Where the bucket list comes from

The term **bucket list** originally comes from the English expression "kick the bucket", which means "kick the bucket". The bucket list - also known as the spoon list - is therefore **a list of things a person wants to do before they die**.

It was made particularly popular by the 2007 movie "[The Bucket List](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Beste_kommt_zum_Schluss)". The movie tells the story of two men who together create a list of things they want to experience before they die. This inspiring story helped to popularize the bucket list as a concept worldwide and encouraged many people to record and pursue their own life dreams.

## Advantages of a bucket list

If you have not yet thought about what you want from life, a bucket list could be a good start to gain **clarity about your life goals**. By reflecting on yourself and writing down your goals, you will get to **know yourself better** and possibly even find your **personal purpose in life**.

Not only will you become more satisfied the more you tick off your list - with each completed goal, you will also get a **motivational boost** that will make it easier for you to achieve your next goal. Reading through your list regularly and reminiscing will also make you **feel good**.

Keep a record of your experiences so that you can remember them again and again.

## What is (not) important for a bucket list

A bucket list is more than just a list of goals - it embodies the personal life dreams of each individual. Each list is **unique** and tailored to individual wishes and aspirations. The following applies: every goal on it stems from a deep desire of the heart - copying or imitating is not desired here.

If you make the effort to create a bucket list, you should also take a look at it from time to time. By reviewing your list **regularly**, you can not only see which goals you have already achieved, but also how your priorities have changed over time. In addition, it can be motivating to see what progress you have already made.

For some, the thought of unfinished items can cause stress and pressure - but that is not the aim of the list. A bucket list should be **fun** and **motivate** you, not weigh you down. It's important to remember that a bucket list is not a race to be won. Life is a long journey and the list should accompany you for many years. Even if you end up with a few items left to complete, the point is to celebrate all the wonderful experiences you've had along the way.

The most important thing in life is to fully enjoy the beautiful moments.

## How to find inspiration for your bucket list

It is often a challenge to imagine what unforgettable experiences you would like to have. But with the right questions and approaches, inspiration can flow. Which **travel destinations** are on your wish list? Is there a **long-cherished dream from your childhood** that you would still like to realize? Or what would you do if you knew that today was your **last day**?

In addition, **talking** to important people, browsing **social media** or reading inspirational **books** can provide further ideas. However, it is important that you do not allow yourself to be too influenced by the dreams of others. Focus on your own dreams and goals to create an authentic bucket list.
