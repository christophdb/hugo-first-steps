## Pure Paleo Power - only the best for the body

[eat Performance](https://eat-performance.com/) is a Berlin-based manufactory for sustainable, healthy and natural snacks and food. Founded in 2013, the two founders Wilhelm and Tobias pursue the goal of producing fresh products daily for online shipping, for their franchising partners and for their own bistro. All foods follow the [Paleo principle](https://eat-performance.com/eat-LIFESTYLE/Vorteile-von-Paleo/), in which all ingredients come from nature and thus completely without cereals, sugar, artificial additives, dyes, preservatives and milk. Especially for athletes, but also for all health-conscious people who want to do something good for themselves and their bodies, Paleo is the ideal diet.

Although you can buy products from eat Performance via Amazon, their own online store or the total of three Berlin stores, the eat Performance team has remained manageable. The entire production, distribution, design and shipping are covered by the small but motivated team. The sales focus has been on online sales from the very beginning, since healthy nutrition appeals to people all over the world.

With the many packages we send out every day, there are always discussions with the shipping service providers when, for example, a package didn't arrive on time. With SeaTable I always have exactly the information I need at hand.

## Organisation is everything

The challenges at eat Performance are many and varied. A comparatively large product range, diverse sales channels, and a small team are not normally the ideal prerequisites for efficient processes. This is probably due to the sporting ambition that drives the two entrepreneurs to avoid superfluous and costly processes and to constantly improve their own operations.

This also led Wilhelm to try SeaTable at the beginning of 2021, and he was thrilled from the start. The flexible structure of the online spreadsheet solution makes it possible to capture and keep track of exactly the information that is needed at any given moment. So Wilhelm uses SeaTable both as a flexible organizational tool to capture and manage all tasks and ideas with his cell phone, but also to monitor goods shipments from eat Performance.

With so many packages being shipped every day, there are occasional handling problems. The resulting complaint to the shipping service providers is anything but pleasant and is probably intended to encourage customers simply not to complain or to write off the package. Thus, eat Performance must submit all information such as the recipient, delivery number and proof of posting in order to even make its claim for reimbursement of postage. With SeaTable, eat Performance always has all the information in one place and the service providers can't talk their way out of it.

There are already plans to map further processes in SeaTable in the future. For example, the planning of social media activities or a customer satisfaction survey would be possible. But already today SeaTable has helped the eat Perfomance team to work easier and faster and to focus on what is central to their work: "Pure Paleo Power" for their customers.

There is no compromise in our ingredients, in our customer satisfaction and also in our IT. SeaTable is intuitive to use and helps us keep our workflows lean and clear.
