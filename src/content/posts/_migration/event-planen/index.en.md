If you want to plan the perfect event, there's a lot to consider. But what's the best place to start if you're not familiar with event management? And how do you avoid planning errors, scheduling conflicts and cancellations?

There is no one universal roadmap for the multitude of events - they all differ in many small details. Nevertheless, this article provides a rough overview of the essential steps that you should definitely consider when planning.

Planning an event means a lot of organizational effort.

## 1\. define the goal of the event

First and foremost, it is crucial in event management to clearly formulate the goal of the event. What is the reason for planning this event? Are you aiming to generate **revenue**? Do you want to increase **brand awareness** or **customer loyalty**? Perhaps you are launching a **new product** and using the event as a platform to introduce it to your customers?

It is also important to determine what kind of event you are planning right at the start. Always bear in mind whether it is an **employee event**, a **customer event** or a **public event** .

This information allows you to make informed decisions during the planning phase and better tailor the event to your target audience.

## 2\. develop concept

When developing your concept, you should concentrate on two main areas: **organizational** and **content**. For the organizational part, for example, determine **how big** your event should be and how **long** it should last. Assign **responsibilities** within your team right at the start so that no tasks are neglected or overlooked.

For the content concept, it is first important to develop an **event idea** and, if necessary, add a suitable **theme**. The theme can later influence the decorations, the dress code and the entertainment program. You should also develop the **program** carefully to ensure that your guests are always entertained and not bored. A consistent **theme** is crucial to give your event a professional touch and impress your guests.

There are many different ways to organize an event.

## 3\. budget planning

To ensure that you do not plan an event that exceeds your budget, it is crucial in event management to carry out detailed [budget planning](https://seatable.io/en/budgetplanung-vorlage/) in advance. Take into account not only obvious expenses, but also less obvious costs such as **licenses**, **travel expenses**, **invitations** as well as **dismantling and cleaning costs**.

**The most important cost points you should consider:**

- **Location:** Costs for renting the venue, including any ancillary costs such as cleaning or security services
- **Technology:** Expenses for the rental of audio, video and lighting technology as well as wage costs for technicians or support staff
- **Catering:** Budget for food and beverages including service charges, tips and any additional expenses for special meal requests
- **Marketing:** Costs for advertising, printing invitations or flyers as well as for online advertising or social media promotion.
- **Entertainment:** Budget for live acts, DJs, artists or other forms of event entertainment.

By carefully planning and budgeting for these main cost points and additional expenses for your event, you can ensure that your event stays within budget and that there are no unexpected costs. If you are planning a commercial event, you can use this as a basis for calculating **how much** you need to charge to cover the costs.

## 4\. create schedule

The be-all and end-all in event management is to start planning early. Reservations for venues or coordinating dates with catering companies require a considerable lead time. To avoid stress during planning, it is therefore advisable to draw up a **detailed schedule**.

Such a schedule not only allows you to determine exactly when which step needs to be taken, but also to identify potential delays at an early stage. It is important to plan in a **buffer** to compensate for unforeseen changes to the plan and thus minimize potential time pressure and stress.

{{< warning headline="Tip" text="Check in advance whether your appointment overlaps with other important dates, public holidays or school vacations." />}}

Time is often a scarce resource in event management.

## 5\. find location

To plan a successful event, you need a suitable location. You have the option of renting a location or using your own rooms. It is important to ensure that there is **enough space** for all guests, the catering, the stage and the technology.

When choosing the right location, it is crucial to keep the **needs of your target group** in mind. For example, check whether there are sufficient **parking spaces** available or whether the location is **barrier-free**. You may also need a garden or other specific requirements that your guests would appreciate.

## 6\. book catering and program

As a general rule, hungry guests are unhappy guests. That's why it's important to provide catering if possible. There are various options to choose from, from **buffets** and **menus** to **finger food** or even **food trucks**. However, make sure you also offer vegetarian and vegan alternatives to meet the needs of all guests.

There are numerous ways to make your supporting program more interesting and ensure that your guests have a good time. In addition to **show artists**, **live bands** or **DJs** can create a good atmosphere. **Speakers** and **presenters** offer an elegant way to guide your event visitors through the event. With **childcare**, you can ensure that guests of all ages can enjoy your event.

Small canap√©s are ideal for a reception.

## 7\. send invitations

If you are planning an event, invitations play a decisive role in your success. By using **personalized invitations**, you can effectively increase the number of attendees. In addition, sending **"Save the Date" notifications** in event management can help to generate interest early and ensure that your guests keep the date free.

Don't forget to include **important information** such as date, time, location and program in the invitations. To make the booking process easier for your guests, it is a good idea to integrate a **ticket booking system**. With a [web form](https://seatable.io/en/docs/webformulare/webformulare/) in [SeaTable's](https://seatable.io/en/event-planen/#Fazit) ready-made [template](https://seatable.io/en/event-planen/#Fazit), you can easily implement this step and enable smooth registration.

You can send invitations both by post and digitally.

## 8\. marketing

To ensure that your event is well attended in the end and that all the planning effort is worthwhile, it is essential to advertise your event extensively. Use all channels through which you can best reach your target group.

For internal [employee events](https://seatable.io/en/weihnachtsfeier-2023/), you can use **notices** in the company, announcements via the **newsletter** or **email invitations**, for example. You can also ask managers to mention the event in **team meetings** so that it spreads through the **grapevine**.

For commercial events such as festivals, targeted advertising via **social media platforms**, **advertisements** in relevant **magazines** and a reference on your own **website** make sense. If you are planning an [art exhibition](https://seatable.io/en/ausstellungs-und-kunstmanagement-museum-galerie/), you can rely on **posters**, **flyers**, **press releases** and the inclusion of **art and culture magazines**.

It is important to start the advertising measures in good time and to prepare the messages in an appealing and informative way in order to arouse the interest of your target group and achieve a high number of visitors.

## 9\. observe safety and legal requirements

To avoid getting into trouble, you should pay particular attention to legal aspects and a proper safety concept in event management. Check in advance whether **official permits** or **insurance** are required for your event. If you offer food, you must comply with the [Food Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/lfgb/). If you are using music, you should check whether a [GEMA license](https://www.gema.de/de) is required. If you use check-in or ticket systems, make sure that they comply with the [General Data Protection](https://dsgvo-gesetz.de) Regulation (GDPR).

At large events, it is important to have plans for **fire protection** or **medical emergencies** in addition to **security personnel** so that your guests are not unnecessarily endangered in the event of an emergency.

![Event management: contracts are signed](images/romain-dancre-doplSDELX7E-unsplash-711x533.jpg)

Find out about the necessary permits in good time.

## 10\. have an emergency plan

An emergency plan is of great importance when planning an event. Despite careful preparation, unforeseen obstacles such as **extreme weather conditions** or **traffic obstructions** can occur. It is therefore essential to have a well thought-out **plan B** in order to be able to react adequately to cancellations or spontaneous changes without being under time pressure or stress.

On the day of the event, it is advisable to call your service providers again to check that everything is going as planned. It is also important to maintain regular **communication** with everyone involved and ensure that your team is aware of the plan. Clear communication and a well-coordinated team are key to being able to react quickly and effectively to unforeseen situations and successfully execute the event.
