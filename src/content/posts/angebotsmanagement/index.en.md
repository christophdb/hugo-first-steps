One thing is crucial for successful sales work: **offer management**. But what is important here? What mistakes should not be made under any circumstances? And what is behind the term "offer management" anyway?

Find out the answers to these questions and why useful software and [online tools]({{< relref "posts/20250308-projektmanagement-methoden" >}}) can help you decisively with your offer management in this article.

## Offer management - definition and key facts

As a central component in sales, quotation management is the important link between external requirements and internal measures. This means that quotation management includes all tasks and processes that are in some way related to inquiries, (potential) orders, and the associated work steps and services.

In general, supply management can be divided into two areas:

- commercial offer management: preparation of offers, calculations, offer processing and financial accounting
- technical offer management: concrete execution of the individual aspects of the offer in practical everyday sales situations

## The typical supply management process

Every (potential) customer is unique and so should every offer be. Nevertheless, there are three fundamental aspects in the entire process that are always the same or very similar. What these are is shown in the following illustration of a typical offer management process:

### 1\. the preparation of the offer

Before you set out on your journey and knock on the customer's proverbial door, a very decisive basic step should have taken place: preparing the offer. This includes:

- Acquisition
- first customer meetings
- Needs assessment

Proposal preparation lays the foundation for your optimal proposal management and for your first impression with a potential new customer.

### 2\. the preparation of the offer

After the initial discussions with the potential new customer, you know their "needs" and what solutions will help them. Now it's time for the second step of offer management, the preparation of the offer. But what should be in the offer? You'll be on the safe side if you consider these four aspects:

- Specification of the solution
- [Price calculation]({{< relref "templates/finance/budget-book" >}})
- Preparation of a written offer
- Sending the written offer to the customer

### 3\. the follow-up

Once the offer has been sent out, you may not hear anything at all for a while. In any case, give the customer some time to read everything in peace and let your suggestions sink in. If you still haven't received a response after two weeks, the follow-up phase of offer management begins. This includes:

- Follow up with the customer
- Price negotiation
- Adjustments to the offer, if necessary
- Contract conclusion

## Common supply management mistakes

At first glance, offer management seems very clear and feasible. Nevertheless, there are a few mistakes that can creep in again and again - and which are avoidable.

### The rash offer

First customer meeting and it's already clear what the needs and solutions are? As a rule, this is not the case. Because this only leads to rash offers in which the customer ultimately does not find himself.

Meaningful offer management works differently. The key to success is proper preparation. Research everything you can about the person you're talking to beforehand, think about where their "needs" might lie, and prepare your conversation as well as you can. The important thing is to let the customer talk. Ask questions and listen. This conveys a sense of interest, respect and professionalism. And these, in turn, are necessary in order to carry out an optimal needs assessment and create a custom-fit offer.

### The 08/15 offer and the overloaded offer

In general, the following applies to the preparation of quotations: Choose a healthy middle ground. This means that completely overloaded offers that extend over several pages and break down every point to the smallest detail are just as unproductive as offers that only contain a few key data but leave a lot of questions unanswered. Make sure that the customer gets as much information as possible, but at the same time as little as necessary.

On the one hand, they should find their needs well reflected in the offer, but on the other hand they should not be overwhelmed by too much information. This is absolutely essential for target-oriented offer management.

### The offer that the customer can not accept directly

This can also happen in offer management: You think your offer is top-notch, but the customer just can't accept it. Why? Because you created the offer far too quickly. Because even if the customer has already requested it in the first meeting, that doesn't mean that you already know all the necessary aspects that will really help the customer.

### The product has no benefit for the customer/bad preparation of the seller

Another common mistake in offer management is that the salesperson has not prepared sufficiently for the potential customer. In the worst case, the product/service being sold has no benefit at all for the customer. Why should he then accept your offer?

### The offer comes to nothing

Perfect offer management also means that you follow up after some time if the customer does not get back to you on their own. In this way, you not only show that the customer is important to you (customer loyalty), but you can also clear up any ambiguities or questions directly and adjust the offer again if necessary.
