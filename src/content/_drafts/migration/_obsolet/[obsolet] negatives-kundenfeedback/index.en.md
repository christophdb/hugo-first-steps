Positive customer feedback is desirable. Nevertheless, it also happens that you receive negative feedback despite all your efforts. However, negative customer feedback does not always have to be bad. It is precisely from this that you can gain valuable insights for improving your processes or your product. Why is customer feedback so important and how do you deal with negative customer feedback? We give you tips!

## Why is customer feedback important?

Customer feedback is important for you and the development of your company in two ways:

1. Appreciation: Asking customers for their opinion shows your interest. Customers feel noticed and get the opportunity to share thoughts and opinions about your product with you. This also increases the customer's bond and loyalty to your company.
2. Foresight: As an entrepreneur, your view of your own product is sometimes clouded. Customer feedback shows you what you do well and where your weak points are. Be it in the features of your product or in your processes. You learn the most from negative feedback. We will now tell you how to deal with it:

## Our tips for dealing with negative criticism

### 1\. reaction

Respond to every negative voice. A negative comment may not seem fair at first glance, but you can see it as an opportunity. For the most part, Internet users even trust companies that receive negative comments! For many users, mistrust arises if the reviews are too good and lead them to assume that the reviews are fake. Important for these customers is your reaction to the negative comments. How do you deal with the criticism? Do you remain friendly and show understanding or do you become unfriendly or not react to the comment at all?

### 2\. apology

Every customer is important. Give the customer enough time to explain the problem and even if the fault was not yours, apologise. This will appease the customer and prevent them from spreading their negative experience even further.

### Solution 3

Most customers are not exclusively malicious in writing negative comments. They are mostly looking for a solution. Find a solution together that satisfies both sides.

### 4\. bonus

To appease the upset customer, it helps to make amends. For example, in the form of a discount that shows your appreciation towards the customer.

### 5\. social media and negative customer feedback

Especially on social media, you should always respond to your customer feedback. In your response, you can simply suggest changing the communication channel. Get in touch by e-mail or telephone. This way, the discussion does not become public and you can reach a satisfactory solution more directly and quickly.
