## Tips for your project time recording

Althoughworking time recordinggoes hand in hand with project time recording, it is usually not carried out as meticulously as it should be. In fact, this often only happens days later, which greatly distorts the actual time required. As a result, valuable hours are lost that you could actually charge your customers for. Furthermore, there are certain activities that are often not included in the project time recording, even though they are of course part of it. These includecustomer or project-related emails, phone calls and meetings.

We have these tips to help you avoid losing money:

1. always encourage yourself and your employees to record project times conscientiously and continuously.

2. note down times to the minute or even stop the time with a project time recording app.

3. also factor in the time you need to communicate with customers or coordinate the project.

4. make project time recording particularly easy with a template in which you can also create invoices.

For example, is there a customer who is always exceeding the estimated project times with long phone calls and coordination loops? Or is one employee drowning in work while others still have capacity? Use statistics to evaluate how long you are working on which projects and which customer is taking up a particularly large amount of time. Continuous project time tracking also provides you with information on how to realistically plan future projects.
