You've just made a plan, a phone call snaps you out of your thoughts and you can't remember what you were about to do? In stressful everyday working life, it often happens that tasks overlap in time and activities run in parallel.

So that you never lose track again, you can easily record your tasks in SeaTable and structure your work with a practical to-do list. Organize your tasks by category, priority and processing status, define subtasks and set deadlines.

With multiple views, Kanban boards and calendars, you can always visualize your tasks the way you need to in order to highlight the aspects of your to-do list that are relevant at the moment. This allows you to make your workflow even more efficient and never forget an important task again.

You can read more about this in our blog article "How to keep track of all tasks with a to-do list".
