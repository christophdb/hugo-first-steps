Create a project portfolio to manage and analyze all your company's projects in one central location. Our free project portfolio tool offers everything you need for this.

### Maintain an overview with our project portfolio tool

In SeaTable, you can record projects, goals, tasks and the responsible departments in various tables and link them together so that you always have an overview. Collect all information about the projects in the first table, e.g. priority, status, kick-off date, deadline and the person responsible for the project. To make the project portfolio as clear as possible, you can group the projects by department.

### Base your decisions on sound data

You can link each project to the data records in the other tables(Goals, Departments, Tasks). For example, the strategic score is calculated automatically when you assign goals from Table 2 to your projects. This score (sum of the stars) indicates how important a project is for your corporate strategy and helps you to determine the priority of a project or to decide whether a requested project is approved or rejected.

### Make resource planning easy for yourself

To enable you to efficiently plan the use of your resources in our project portfolio tool, distribute budgets and precisely track project progress, there are several formula columns that add up the values from Table 3 - for example, the estimated time required, the actual time required and the estimated costs per project. In addition, you can calculate the maximum possible working hours per year and the remaining time resources per department in Table 4 at department level.

### Visualize your data with our project portfolio tool

- **TREE-PLUGIN**: Use this plugin to display all data records in your project portfolio in a hierarchy. This allows you to see at a glance which projects are assigned to which departments and which tasks belong to the projects.
- **TIMELINE-PLUGIN**: Display your projects as bars on a timeline using the date columns (kick-off and deadline). In this view, overlaps are immediately apparent, which simplifies resource planning.
- **KANBAN-PLUGIN**: Visualize the project phases and workflows on Kanban boards. You can easily change the status of a task using drag-and-drop.

### Reach your goal with a customized Project Web App

Create your own project app without any programming knowledge or use the ready-made Project Web App here to provide the various project participants with exactly the data that is relevant to them. You can use the page permissions to precisely define who can perform certain actions (e.g. submit project ideas). On individual dashboards, you have the option of presenting the figures and data from your tables with statistics, images and other elements.
