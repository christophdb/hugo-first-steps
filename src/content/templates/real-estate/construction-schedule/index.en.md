      - q: "Is SeaTable's construction schedule template free? "
        a: 'Yes, all you need to use the construction schedule template software for free is a free SeaTable account.'
      - q: "Why do I need a construction schedule at all?"
        a: "A structured plan helps you to maintain an overview and coordinate everyone involved in the project. In the event of delays or problems in a construction phase, you can see the effects at a glance and act accordingly."
      - q: "What advantages does SeaTable offer compared to a construction schedule in Excel?"
        a: 'A construction schedule in Excel can work for smaller projects with very few people involved. For larger, more complex projects, however, you will find that a construction schedule template in Excel reaches its limits: error-prone manual maintenance, difficult to understand data links, limited visual representations. SeaTable, on the other hand, offers simple functions for data linking and automated data processing and displays relationships between data sets visually.'
      - q: 'For whom is SeaTable suitable as software for a construction schedule?'
        a: "SeaTable is suitable both for private builders who need a clear construction schedule for their single-family home and for architects who need to coordinate multiple projects."
