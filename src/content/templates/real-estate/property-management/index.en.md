If you own and rent out several properties, you will quickly face organizational challenges: you need to store information and photos of your rental properties, record your tenants' data and documents, monitor rental income every month and have maintenance and repairs carried out.

It's good that you can cover all your property management with a single database in SeaTable: In our template you can record and manage all your properties, tenants, revenues, documents and tasks in a structured and clear way. Store addresses, photos, size and equipment of your rental properties and link them to further tables where you can

- Document your monthly rental income,
- Capture confidential information about your tenants,
- Coordinate service providers and process maintenance orders,
- Organize tasks such as apartment viewings and
- save important documents such as contracts.

You can find more information on property management in our blog article.
