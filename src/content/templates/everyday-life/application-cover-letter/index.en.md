The first step on the way to your dream job is a successful application. However, it usually doesn't stop at a single application and it's easy to lose track of the ever-changing cover letters, the required documents and the status of the applications. To make it easier for you to plan your applications, SeaTable has developed a structured planner for your job search.

Keep track of all relevant information for your application and see at a glance the current status of your applications and which application deadlines are approaching (Table 1). Link the documents specified in your application, such as the cover letter and CV, separately (Table 2). To make it easier for you to create your cover letter, SeaTable offers a template in the page design plugin in which all formal details are already pre-filled.

You can find more information on how to write a successful cover letter and increase your chances of getting an interview in ourblog article.
