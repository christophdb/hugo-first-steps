If you appreciate good books, you'll love SeaTable: Because with our book app, you can bring order to your private library! Whether the tomes are piled up on your desk, filling walls of shelves or in boxes - with SeaTable you always know where a book is.

Record all the works of your favorite authors with title, year of publication, ISBN and page number in this digital database. With colourful single and multiple selection columns, you can categorize the books according to language, reading status, fictionality, genres and topics. Rate how much you like the books and create your personal ranking list in a further view.

With the help of link columns, you can assign authors and publishers to books in two additional tables and save additional information such as images, biographies and locations. Do you like to share your books with your friends, relatives or colleagues? Then enter in the fourth table who has borrowed a book from you and for how long.

You can find more information on how to catalog your bookshere.
