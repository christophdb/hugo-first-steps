## Create your individual digital food diary with SeaTable

Use our food diary app for free and record your meals and eating habits with little effort. Since SeaTable is completely customizable, you can also adapt the template (and the Unversal App) to your individual needs and add additional columns, tables, notifications, automations, links and much more - and thus create your own personal food diary.

### Food diary app

Record all meals and snacks with the foods and drinks they contain in the "Eating habits and complaints" base. You can easily enter all data via a customizable web form in the Universal App and adjust it at any time. Group and filter your entries or create new views to identify connections. By linking to the "Intolerances and allergies" table, you can see at a glance which complaints could be related to allergies or intolerances.

### Database for intolerances and allergens

SeaTable's food diary app is more than just a simple food log app. In the integrated and expandable database of food intolerances and allergies in the "Intolerances and allergies" table, you can see the most common symptoms and allergenic foods listed for each intolerance. Cross-reactions can be recorded in a separate column. The database in our food diary app is already pre-filled with the most common intolerances and allergies and can be expanded as required.

### Universal app for data collection and evaluation

Your food diary app consists of two parts: an Excel-like database and a no-code universal app as the front end. Here you will find the data entry form, an analysis dashboard, an overview of daily fluid intake and the search mask for the intolerance database. You can easily add more pages to the app and adapt it to your needs.
