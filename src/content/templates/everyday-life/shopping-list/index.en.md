How often have you stood in front of the supermarket and realized that you forgot your shopping list at home? Instead, use a digital shopping list that you can access from anywhere in the world with your smartphone! You can even share it with your family members or roommates so that they can also add purchases to the list.

Enter all the products you need in the first table. You can divide the products into categories using single selection columns or sort them by name in an alphabetical list. This makes it easy to find the items you need when creating your shopping list. Simply uncheck the boxes and the products will be displayed in the filtered "Shopping list" view. In this view, which you use when shopping, the entries disappear again when you click on the boxes. As soon as you have ticked everything on your shopping list, this view is empty.

You can link the products to both the recipes (table 2) for which you need them and the stores (table 3) where you prefer to buy them. You can also use the map plugin to display the location of the stores and plan your shopping route. It makes sense to put your purchases in a certain order - depending on where the products can be found. This allows you to move efficiently through the stores and get everything you need in the shortest possible time.
