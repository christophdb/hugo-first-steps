Man's best friend - a pet brings you joy, is a kindred spirit or is simply beautiful to look at. But keeping a pet is also a lot of work, because in addition to everyday duties such as walking and feeding, you also have to attend vet appointments or organize care for your absences.

SeaTable has therefore designed a template in which you can record all the information about your pet in a structured way. Upload photos (Table 1) and documents (Table 4) of your pets. Keep track of your finances by documenting the expenses for your pets (Table 2). Track the health of your pets (Table 3) and record which food is healthy for your pets (Table 5). The calendar plugin also provides a precise overview of the weekly tasks that arise in connection with your animals. Create a plan of who in your family is responsible for which tasks (Table 6).

You can find more information on what you should pay attention to in order to keep your pet in a species-appropriate way in ourblog article.
