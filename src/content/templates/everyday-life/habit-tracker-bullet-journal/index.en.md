We often make good resolutions for the future and then don't manage to follow them through. On the other hand, many unpleasant patterns of behavior have become established in our everyday lives and have quietly and secretly become habits. Getting rid of them or, in the best case, turning them into good habits requires a lot of time, discipline and perseverance. But with a habit tracker, you can succeed in this endeavor.

In the SeaTable template, you can record your goals in a structured way and track your habits day by day. The calendar plugin offers you a filtered view for each activity, in which you can immediately see the days on which you performed it. In the second table, which represents a bullet journal, you can record diary entries and rate them with a mood barometer in addition to the tracked activities (from table 1) and important appointments (from table 3).
