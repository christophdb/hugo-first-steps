This student planner was developed in collaboration with Maxine. Maxine studies STEM at the University of Waterloo. STEM is an acronym that stands for Mathematics, Engineering, Science and Technology.

Maxine has developed a student planner so that you don't lose track of things in your stressful everyday study life. In addition to a table for your timetable, you can also record your to-dos and track your time per task. To track time, theClockifyapp has been integrated viaZapierso that the time recorded there appears immediately in your SeaTable Base. By creating statistics, you can see how much time you have spent on each course and generally observe and analyze your productivity habits.

If you would like to find out more about Maxine's student planner,please read her blog post. It also explains the integration of Clockify step by step.
