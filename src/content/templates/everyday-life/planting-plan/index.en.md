A structured planting plan in SeaTable helps you to design your garden sustainably and efficiently. Whether you want to create a flower bed, plant vegetables or simply plan your bed - with this template you can keep a central overview of planting, care and harvest times.

## Plan your beds with a system

You can record your bed in the central table - including rows, planting and crop rotation. Particularly practical: the links to the plants make it easier for you to plan quickly over several years. This makes SeaTable very easy to use as an intuitive bed planner.

## Create your own plant encyclopedia

The second table is your personal plant encyclopaedia: whether ornamental plants, herbs or useful plants - here you can store all the information on winter hardiness, lifespan, size or suitable bed neighbors. This not only helps with planning, but also gives you new ideas and inspiration when planting beds.
