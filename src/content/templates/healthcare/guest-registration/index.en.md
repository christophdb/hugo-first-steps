This template is an out-of-the-box solution for capturing guest data in restaurants, bars and cafés during the Corona pandemic. No paper, no pens, no hassle - this template contains everything you need to digitise guest registration.

The key to this template is the guest registration form. Guests scan the form's QR code with their smartphone camera and then enter their contact information on their own device. The template also includes three pre-configured views: All Registrations, Today and To Delete. The latter filters out all registrations older than one month. They should be deleted to comply with data protection regulations.
