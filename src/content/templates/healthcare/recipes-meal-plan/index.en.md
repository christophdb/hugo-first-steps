Have you also lost track of which website you found which favorite recipe on? And when you need spontaneous ideas of what to cook, you can't think of anything again? Simply record all your recipes systematically in a database, create a clear meal plan for the coming weeks and share it with your family members or flatmates. It's easy with SeaTable.

Bundle all the information about your favorite recipes in one place, upload photos and be inspired by your gallery of possible dishes week after week. In SeaTable you can rate each dish or sort them by difficulty and preparation time. Simply enter the day you want to cook the dish next time in the date column and use the calendar to get an overview of your meal plan. You can enter all the ingredients and nutritional values for your favorite dishes in the linked tables.
