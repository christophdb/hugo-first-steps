Managing your employees' leave requests can sometimes be quite tedious. Especially with manually completed leave slips or Excel spreadsheets, it can quickly become confusing and you don't know whether absences are duplicated or how many days of leave your employees still have left. To ensure that you don't lose track of this, you need comprehensive software that makes it easier for you to manage applications.

With our template for leave requests, you cover the entire process from application to approval. Your employees submit each request via a web form and the data immediately appears in a table where it is only visible to you. You receive an automatic notification and can then process the requests via your Kanban board. You can easily identify overlapping vacation periods in the calendar. You can then decide whether to approve or reject the request.

Your employees receive a notification every time the status of their request changes. They can see all their vacation requests in their own shared view.In our blog post, we explain in detail all the benefits and steps involved in vacation planning with SeaTable.
