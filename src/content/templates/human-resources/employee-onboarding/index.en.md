To ensure that everything runs smoothly on your new employees' first day at work, it is important for you in the HR department to start with a checklist in good time and structure the entire onboarding process. Some points, such as feedback meetings, IT training or introductions to business customers, may not be ticked off immediately after the first week. In order not to lose sight of these dates and to-dos, you can use our template profitably for your onboarding.

With just one click, you can create a checklist for each new employee. A script is executed that copies the general onboarding activities into the "Onboarding checklist" table. This means that you and your new employees no longer have to keep manual lists on paper, but can work together digitally and in real time on the same data record.

This allows you to maintain an overview and track the progress of the training live. You can easily store documents such as house rules, site plans and much more in various file formats. Whether you, your new employees or the IT department - thanks to the checklist, everyone knows exactly what needs to be done. So you can look forward to onboarding with peace of mind.
