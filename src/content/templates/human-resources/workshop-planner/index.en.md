Workshops for the internal training of your employees are not only important for your company, but also for existing and future employees, as structured personnel development increases the attractiveness of your workplaces. Managing workshops, trainings and seminars can quickly become a big task, especially when there is a lot of demand in different subject areas.

This is exactly where SeaTable comes in and, as a database, offers the possibility to map all information and matters relating to the workshops in one process. A web form is used to register employees for the workshops as well as to evaluate the feedback. All entered information immediately ends up in the base and can be evaluated.In our blog post, you will learn in detail which functions are available to you in this template and what advantages they have.
