Especially in companies without a central employee database, it is important to create an employee directory - not only for your overview, but also to always have all relevant contact details to hand. With a detailed directory, not only do you know which employees work where, but also important authorities such as the managing director. Your employees will also get to know each other better. This has a positive effect on the company culture!

Keep track of all employees in your company with our practical template. By recording departments, positions, personal data and much more, you know at a glance who is responsible for reporting and where. A structured employee directory can replace a company organization chart and enables your employees to have clarity about their respective responsibilities and contact points.
