Are you planning an image video for your company or are you looking for a way to define the visual elements for your next YouTube video? Storyboarding is an essential step in this process. A well-designed storyboard not only saves time and money by identifying potential problems at an early stage, but above all, it presents the plot of the script in pictures or drawings.

Use this template to record all the information you need for a successful video shoot. From plot and roles to props and costumes, all details are summarized in a clear table that you can share with your team. In addition, you can add important notes for your cameraman or editor to ensure that no details of your vision are lost. Summarize the most important data compactly with the gallery plugin.
