      - q: "Can I use SeaTable's NPS template free of charge?"
        a: 'Yes, you can use SeaTable and all templates free of charge for an unlimited period of time. With a free account, you have all the functions you need to conduct even extensive surveys. You can evaluate your Net Promoter Score directly in SeaTable and create attractive reporting dashboards.'
      - q: "How does an NPS score calculator work?"
        a: "In an NPS survey, your customers indicate on a scale of 0-10 the likelihood with which they would recommend your company or product to others. Based on the answers, your customers are divided into Detractors (0-6), Passives (7-8) and Promoters (9-10). Your current NPS results from the relative share of promoters minus the relative share of detractors and can be between -100 and +100. A good Net Promoter Score template should contain an integrated NPS calculator."
      - q: "Can I customize the Net Promoter Score template?"
        a: 'Yes, you can customize any SeaTable template to suit your needs. The survey form in our Net Promoter Score Calculator template already includes additional questions on customer satisfaction and can be expanded as required, e.g. to create a comprehensive customer survey.'
