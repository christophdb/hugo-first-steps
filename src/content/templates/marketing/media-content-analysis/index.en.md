What do journalists write about your company and what image does your brand have in the media? Analyze all content and articles in which your name appears.

List the most important data about each article to get an overview of the media, formats and subject areas. At the content level, you can code whether quotes, images or links to your website are included. Also note how the author presents your company and whether he or she expresses any criticism.

Enter the media in which the articles were published in another table. This gives you an impression of how much potential reach the media content has in which countries. With the statistics, you can ideally evaluate and visualize your company's media presence.

You can find more information on how to evaluate articles about your company using qualitative content analysis in ourblog article.
