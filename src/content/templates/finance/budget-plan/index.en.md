Have you already planned your budget for next year? This template helps you to analyze the expenses from the current financial year in order to derive forecasts for the future and align your budget plan with your business goals. It is suitable for any company, department or project team that has budget available.

The template assumes that a growing company with currently around 15 employees would like to plan its budget for 2024. The example company offers services, so there are no production costs. All tables in this template are linked to each other via link columns, allowing the data to be related to each other.

First, the management evaluates all 2023 operating costs (Table 2) and compares the figures with the 2023 budget plan (Table 3). If the budget for a cost center was exceeded, the responsible managers (Table 4) explain why the estimated budget was not sufficient. They then formulate their expectations and targets for the next year in the 2024 budget plan (Table 1). Based on their analyses and targets, the managers set a realistic budget for how much money they want to spend in 2024.
