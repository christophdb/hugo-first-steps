Many drivers of company cars are familiar with this problem: the logbook is damaged, illegible or perhaps even completely lost. But the solution to this everyday problem could hardly be simpler: a digital logbook! With this logbook template, you and your employees can easily record all journeys online - conveniently, securely and at any time.

## How the logbook template works

All daily journeys can be documented easily and directly via a web form. SeaTable even generates an individual QR code that can be affixed to the vehicle interior. This means you can simply scan the code every time you start your journey and access the form directly.

Manage several vehicles in one base and store all important documents such as insurance policies, fuel receipts or MOT certificates centrally in one place. Thanks to the clear statistics, you are always well informed about the use of the vehicles. For example, you can see at a glance how many kilometers have been driven in total and how high the proportion of private journeys is.
