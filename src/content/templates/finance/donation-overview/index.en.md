This template is designed for associations or non-profit organizations that receive donations for social projects. Record all donations in a clear table, create donation receipts at the push of a button and keep track of the financial progress at any time.

In this template everything starts with a project. Choose a name and the donation goal. Then you can start collecting donations and see at any moment how much you still need to reach the donation goal.

As soon as you record a donation, you can create a corresponding donation receipt in the form of a PDF document with just one click. You can request the necessary information for this via predefined web form.

In this way, you reduce the administrative effort to a minimum.
