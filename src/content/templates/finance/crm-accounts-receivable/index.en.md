All receivables or invoices to your customers must be neatly recorded and tracked. It is not always possible to keep the best possible overview of the individual receivables. Which customer has already paid his invoice? Which customer still has a payment outstanding? And which customer has not yet been able to pay his invoices for various reasons?
