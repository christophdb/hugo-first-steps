In everyday business life, it is not always easy to make the right decisions. You have to consider many aspects and factors and often have to assess the impact of certain measures without any empirical values. It's good that you can put your decisions on a solid footing with a cost-benefit analysis.

With our template, you can reliably weigh up the costs and benefits of your planned investments. Collect all ideas for improving your company, regardless of whether they come from you or your employees. Think about what goals you can achieve with a measure and estimate the financial benefit you expect from it in the first three years.

Then list the individual costs in the second table, which is linked to Table 1. The total costs are totaled using a linking formula. Another formula column is used to calculate the estimated cost benefit (total benefit minus total costs). The colors indicate whether the value is positive or negative, so you can immediately see which investments are profitable and which are not.

Now you have an evaluation basis for your decision as to whether you want to implement or reject the project. Will your company benefit from the investment in the long term? Then set the status to "approved".
