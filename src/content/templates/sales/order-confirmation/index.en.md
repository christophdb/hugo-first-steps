## When you should create an order confirmation

An order confirmation is the process by which a customer accepts your offer and you confirm to the customer that your company will carry out the order on the agreed terms. Please note that the order confirmation must match the negotiated offer. Only then is itlegally bindinganda contract is concluded. However, if the details (e.g. scope of services, price or quantity) in the offer and order confirmation are notidentical, no contract is concluded and the customer must agree again.

If everything is already precisely regulated in the accepted offer, you can alsodispense with a written order confirmation. Nevertheless, it is useful to avoid misunderstandings, especially if the offer has been changed several times or if some time has passed since the offer was accepted. You can also specify delivery dates and payment terms in the order confirmation, but it does not replace an invoice. The order confirmation only states the price of the agreed services.

### Cases in which a written order confirmation is important

- Your customer has only placed the order verbally (e.g. on the phone).

- Your customer has placed an order without first having received a quote.

- Essential contractual conditions remained unclear in the offer.

- Several versions of your offer exist due to negotiations.

- Your customer has only placed the order after the offer deadline has expired.

You can alsohave your customer signthe order confirmation if you want to make sure that they agree to the terms of the contract. Your customer can also confirm the offer in writing with their signature.

## How to create a professional order confirmation

Although there are no legal requirements as to what information a written order confirmation must contain, thedetails must not deviate from the accepted offer. If you use our template for the order confirmation, you are always on the safe side, as SeaTable uses the same data as in the corresponding offer.

The following mandatory information should not be missing in any order confirmation to customers:

1. when you write an order confirmation, thenameandaddress of your companyusually form the letterhead together with yourcompany logo.

2. you need thenameandaddress of the client/customernot only for the delivery, but also for tax reasons - because services to companies are taxable where the client is based.

3.subject lineandorder number: A clear, consecutive numbering of your orders makes it easier to assign them in future correspondence with your customers.

4. the direct salutation with thename of the contact persongives your order confirmation a personal touch.

5 The exact service description with the individualitems (type, price and quantity)forms the main part of your order confirmation. It must be clear to what extent you are selling your products or services.

6 Now it's time to get down to business: add up the individual items to thenet amount, deduct adiscountif necessary and, for domestic customers, also calculate the gross amount including VAT.

7 For corporate customers abroad, you will need theVAT identification number. Inform these customers that they must pay the VAT in their respective country themselves (tax liability of the service recipient).

8. do not forget thecurrent dateand thedate the order was placedwhen you write an order confirmation. Optionally, you can also state adelivery date.

9. conclude the text with a friendly closing and agreeting. It is best to also refer to yourGeneral Terms and Conditions (GTC)when sending an order confirmation to customers.

10. yourbank details,VAT IDand other relevant company data should be included in the letterhead of your order confirmation template.
