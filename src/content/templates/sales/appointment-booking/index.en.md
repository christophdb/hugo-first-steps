## Appointment bookings

Use this template to optimise the planning of appointments, meetings and events. The aim is to avoid the problematic back and forth when setting appointments. Instead of email chains and phone calls, you can define your availability in advance and your conversation partners choose a suitable appointment via a web form generated by SeaTable. They do not need a SeaTable account to book an appointment.
