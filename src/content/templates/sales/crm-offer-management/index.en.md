Everyone in your company, from the sales force to marketing and purchasing to the finance department, should always have an overview of customers, customer appointments, sales and much more. The intuitive benefit should always be in the foreground. If you are looking for a good CRM system, you can quickly end up with expensive software solutions such asSalesforceorSAP-Hybris.
