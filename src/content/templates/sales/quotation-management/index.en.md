Well done! If you have to write a quotation for a customer, you have already successfully aroused interest in your products or services.

Why not use SeaTable'squotation templateright away, with which you can create every quotation online - free of charge, conveniently and securely!

## Why you should write an offer

A clearly and attractively designedoffer letterincreases the likelihood that your prospective customer will ultimately take the bait. It serves as a mutual assurance and makes it clear whatservicesyour customer can expect for thepricequoted. While an informal email may be sufficient for a small order, you should definitely prepare a written offer for larger orders in order to document the proposed contractual conditions. The more precisely you specify theitems in the quotation, the fewer misunderstandings are possible.

Especially if you receive inquiries every day, it can take a lot of time and nerves to writeindividual offersthat you have to reformulate again and again - without knowing whether your offers will actually result in orders. This is where a professional quotation template provides a quick and reliable remedy, especially for small businesses. Use SeaTable, for example, to write your quotationefficientlyandautomatically.

The following mandatory information should not be missing from any offer template:

1. when you write an offer, thenameandaddress of your companyusually form the letterhead together with yourcompany logo.

2. you need thenameandaddress of the client/customernot only for the delivery, but also for tax reasons - because services to companies are taxable where the client is based.

3.subject lineandquotation number: A clear, consecutive numbering of your quotations makes it easier to assign them in future correspondence with your customers.

4. the directsalutationwith the name of the contact person gives your offer letter a personal touch.

5 The exact description of the offer with the individualitems(type, price and quantity of the service) forms the main part of your offer. It must be clear to what extent you are offering your products or services.

6 Now it's time to get down to business: add up the individual items to thenet amount, deduct adiscountif necessary and, for domestic customers, also calculate the gross amount includingVAT.

7 For business customers abroad, you need theVAT identification numberwhen you write an offer. Point out to these customers that they must pay the VAT in their respective country themselves (tax liability of the recipient of the service).

8.dateandvalidity: Don't forget the actual date when you create an offer and add a deadline by which the customer can accept it. As a rule, the period for which you are legally bound by your offer should only be a few weeks.

9. conclude the offer text with a friendlyclosingand agreeting. It is also best to draw the customer's attention to yourGeneral Terms and Conditions (GTC)in the offer letter.

10. yourbank details,VAT IDand other relevant company data should be included in the letterhead of your offer template.

## Win customers by writing transparent offers

Naturally, your potential customers have a great interest in knowing the exactcostsbefore placing an order. However, it can be difficult for service providers to correctly estimate all costs and quote binding fixed prices, especially when it comes to longer-term services - for example, when writing a quote for a construction project. In this case, acost estimateis recommended, which offers significantly more leeway.

### What is the difference between a quote and a cost estimate?

If you write an offer, the prices and services stated arelegally bindingunless you have stated otherwise in the offer template. If the offer is accepted, apurchase contractis concluded directly with the customer. On the other hand, a cost estimate is only anon-binding forecastor apreliminary calculationof costs that are subject to change.

Therefore, make sure to mark your offer letter with afreedom clausesuch as "non-binding offer" if you want to keep the option open to withdraw it or adjust the conditions. Ideally, make this clear in your GTC and mention it in the offer template.

But be careful: even with a cost estimate, the final price should not deviate from your estimate by more than 15 percent. If you are faced withunexpected costs or additional expenses, you must first obtain the customer's approval. Therefore, always calculate realistically.
