The SWOT analysis (acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a useful method for understanding the current positioning and strategy of your company. It helps to leverage strengths, minimize weaknesses, identify opportunities and manage potential risks at an early stage. With a clearly structured analysis, you create the basis for well-founded decisions and sustainable success.

Discover your potential with this free SWOT analysis template, get an overview of all relevant factors and develop a customized action plan that effectively supports your goals.

## Create your own SWOT analysis with this template

List all the important factors of your company in the clearly structured first table of the SWOT analysis template. Assign each aspect to its origin - internal or external - and rate its impact on your company as positive or negative. This quickly shows whether it is a strength (internal + positive), a weakness (internal + negative), an opportunity (external + positive) or a risk (external + negative). Use this classification to minimize risks in a targeted manner: By compensating for internal weaknesses, you can significantly reduce risks and turn them into valuable opportunities.
