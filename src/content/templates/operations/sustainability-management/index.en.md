Sustainability management in companies requires not only an understanding of environmental issues, but also a structured approach and organizational skills. As with other long-term projects, sustainable initiatives must be planned, coordinated and implemented company-wide.

You can use this template to systematically set up and effectively implement your sustainability management. Not only can you centrally record all relevant information on your environmental goals, but you can also take into account measures for social responsibility and economic efficiency.

Document important key figures and see at a glance whether you have achieved your goals. You can also record sustainability certificates that you already have or would like to obtain.
