After sending, the request appears immediately in your table and you can process it. As the tables arelinked to each other, you can assign each request to an employee and the desired vehicle. You can then check whether the vehicle is available at the desired time or whether it is already booked for that period. Use thetimeline plug-infor this, which clearly displays overlapping bookings.
