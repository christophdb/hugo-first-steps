Managing art exhibitions, museums or art galleries requires not only artistic know-how, but also organizational skills. After all, like any type of event, art exhibitions have to be planned, organized and implemented. The special feature here, however, is the preparation and organization of the art treasures and all their specific information.

You can use this template to manage any type of exhibition, museum or gallery. Here you can not only collect all relevant information on the artworks centrally, but also on the artists, loans, insurance, restoration measures and important contacts such as donors or art critics. All data relating to your art gallery or museum can be stored in this SeaTable overview.

You can find more information on this template in the comprehensive articleArt management - how to manage museums and galleries digitally.
