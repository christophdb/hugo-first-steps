A technology roadmap, also known as an IT roadmap, is nothing more than a very well structured project plan that communicates a company's strategy and serves internally as a guideline and orientation within the project processes. The roadmap enables long-term planning and allows the visualisation and prioritisation of important milestones in projects.

With the "Technology Roadmap" template, you can structure and evaluate your development process in different stages and easily assign the right project tasks to employees.

Other functions:

- The template offers 2 views: The "Release" view represents your roadmap, which guides your entire project. It shows which milestones your teams still have to master. The "Effort" view helps you to better identify the priorities of your next steps.
- From the "Supervisor" spreadsheet, your team can quickly pull out all the important information on team members to get in touch with. At the same time, it serves as a selection list of project supervisors for the "Initiatives" section.
- You can work on a project with several teams and employees at the same time, ensuring that each employee knows the relevant tasks.
- All users have the possibility to exchange files and notes centrally without having to switch to another cloud system. This saves time and nerves, as SeaTable bundles all information centrally.
