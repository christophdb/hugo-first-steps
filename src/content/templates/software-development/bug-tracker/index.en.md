When developing and testing complex software, you will inevitably come across bugs. You should systematically record, document and fix these software errors so that your software runs smoothly or is released on time. Thanks to SeaTable's bug tracking system, you can maintain an overview and organize close collaboration between developers, testers and UI/UX designers.

There are three important levels here: the problems found (Table 1), the tests carried out (Table 2) and the versions tested (Table 3). If you do not have a bug tracker or a poorly structured bug tracker freeware, these elements often get mixed up. SeaTable's free bug tracker tool, on the other hand, helps you to easily document bugs in your software, assign them to people and initiate a structured solution process.

The bug tracker template offers an intuitive Kanban view in which you can clearly organize all software bugs by status. You can also easily record bugs and problems that come to light during your tests using a web form. With the help of the Tree plugin, you can navigate effortlessly through the linked tables and always keep your bearings, even with lots of data in the bug tracker.
