Do you offer health and sports courses? Do you work in an educational institution or are you planning other events in person or virtually? Then a digital attendee list is just the thing for you! Find out all about SeaTable'sfree attendance list templateand the advantages compared to a conventional attendance list in Excel or handwritten lists on paper.

## What is an attendance list?

The participants of an event enter their attendance in an attendance list to confirm their presence at an appointment.

## Is an attendance list the same as a list of participants?

No, an attendance list is not the same as a list of participants. But a list of participants is more or less the template for the attendance list: While alist of participantsshows which people have registered for an event - regardless of whether they actually come - theattendance listdocuments the actual attendance of people at an event.

You can plan your eventsin advancewith an attendee list template. The attendance list, on the other hand, can be signedon the respective dates. Nowadays, the attendance list is often createddigitallyusing an Excel template, but is still printed out onpaperfor signing. You can find out how to do it differently below.

## Why do you need an attendance list?

With an attendance list, you can keep track of who has attended which dates. Based on this, you can, for example, issue course participants with acertificateofattendance. A signed list of participants may also be required for meetings so that votes are truly binding. Based on theattendance rate, you can usually also draw conclusions about how well the event is received by the participants.

## Legal requirements for a list of participants

Pay attention to theGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)for every list of participants that serves as a template for an attendance list. In particular, if sensitive personal data such as address or health data is involved, the participants should have consented to the processing of their data.

It is equally important toprotectyour attendee list, e.g. in Excel,from unauthorized access. A software solution that allows you to authorize only certain people to access the attendee list offers better protection than an Excel template. You should also check whether the attendance list for your eventneeds to be retained.

## What should you include in a list of participants?

It is up to you which data you request from your participants. However, when you create a list of participants, some information is always necessary: this includes thenamesandcontact details(email address, telephone number) of the participants. Furthermore, depending on the purpose of the event, theaddress,date of birth,genderor certainprevious knowledge and qualificationsmay also be relevant.

In an attendance list, you should never forget thetitle and date of the eventas well as a field for thesignature. Of course, you will also find all this information in the SeaTable attendance list template, so you don't have to create a new Excel template for your attendance list.

## How to create a template for your attendance list without Excel

SeaTable combines the power of a database with the simplicity of an Excel template to create an attendance list. If you would like to enter additional information besides the sample data, you can customize our free attendance list template according to your needs by adding columns for the required information.

## The attendance list template with integrated list of participants

SeaTable makes it easy to organize and manage events such as courses, seminars or training sessions. In the first table, you first list all thedates of your event. Here you can also enter details about the teacher, venue and duration as well asdocuments. We have taken a series of lectures at a university as an example.

The second table contains theparticipant list template. Information (e.g. matriculation number, degree program and email address) of students who have registered for the lecture is stored here. At the end of the lecture period, you can createattendance certificatesat the touch of a button for those who have regularly attended the lecture.

## Automatic data collection with web forms

Use intuitive web forms in which your participants cansign digitallyandenter data themselves. After submission, the data isautomaticallysaved in your tables. The attendance list template in table 3 also works withlinksto tables 1 and 2: participants only need to select the current date and their name from the list of participants before confirming their attendance with their signature.
