The death of a loved one often comes as a surprise and is associated with a great deal of grief for relatives. In this emotionally stressful time, it is not easy for many people to take care of planning a funeral.

To help you through this difficult time, SeaTable has created a template that allows you to organize a funeral according to the wishes of the deceased. Plan the smooth process and costs of the funeral in a clear table. By recording the funeral guests in a second table and linking them, you can assign tasks to them. Don't try to do everything yourself, but ask family and friends of the deceased for help.

In addition, we have created a checklist with the most important to-dos for you in a third table. Because especially in the beginning, many mourners are overwhelmed and don't know what they should actually start with. Our checklist sets clear priorities and gives you an overview of what you should think about first. You can find more helpful information on planning a funeral in ourblog article.
