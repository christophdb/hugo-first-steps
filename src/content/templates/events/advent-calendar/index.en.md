Christmas is just around the corner and the anticipation is growing. But before the big present awaits on Christmas Eve, there is still a little door to open every day from the Advent calendar.

Would you like to make individual Advent calendars for your loved ones and fill them personally with small gifts? Or would you prefer a digital Advent calendar to share with family, friends or colleagues? The advent calendar template from SeaTable will help you with all of this!

Create a view for each person you want to surprise with an advent calendar and think about which surprise should be hidden behind which door (table 2). Make it easier for yourself to buy the calendar fillings and let SeaTable calculate the number of gifts you need (table 3). There is also a Christmas saying and a YouTube video to discover behind each door. With the help of an app, you can display the pictures of all the little doors in a beautiful gallery.

We have also created a digital advent calendar for companies, where each door hides a Christmas idea that you can use to surprise your employees or customers (Table 1). Let yourself be inspired and use our template including app to create a digital advent calendar for your company.

Simply share the link to your digital Advent calendar with family, friends and colleagues and spread the Christmas spirit! You can find more tips and ideas in our blog articles:
