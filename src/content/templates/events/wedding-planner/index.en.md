Planning a wedding is a lot of work and requires a lot of organizational talent. It's not for nothing that there are wedding planners who do exactly that for a living: organize one of the most beautiful days of your life. Whether you are a wedding planner or want to plan your wedding all by yourself: SeaTable will help you keep track of all the tasks. In our comprehensive checklist with over200 to-dos, you will have all the tasks on your screen in the run-up to the wedding.

You can use our evaluation lists to make informed decisions about your caterer, location, florist and entertainment program. In addition, our guest list not only helps you to send out invitations, but also to plan the menu and create a seating plan.

There is also a budget tracker to help you keep an eye on your finances. You can share your SeaTable Base in full or in part with others. This way you can get support with the planning or simply pass on information to the various parties involved (witnesses, caterers, photographers, etc.).

You can read a detailed explanation of how to turn SeaTable into your own personal wedding planner in our blog articleThe perfect wedding planner with SeaTable.
