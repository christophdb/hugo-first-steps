Once you have created a shared data set, you can perform various operations to manage your data set. You can access the overview of your shared data records via the start page.

## How to manage your shared data records

1. Open the **home** page of SeaTable.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required"  text="You can only perform these management operations if you are the **creator of** the shared data record. The **three dots are hidden** for data records that are only released to one of your groups." />}}

## Retrieve details of a shared data record

If you use shared data sets extensively in your team, it can be easy to lose track. To which **groups** is a shared data record released and in which **bases** is it integrated? You can view this information under **Details**.

## Manage access authorizations

You can use the **Manage access** option to share your shared data set with another group or withdraw access again. You can find out exactly how this works [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/freigabe-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes-an-eine-andere-gruppe/).

## Force synchronization with the shared data set

As the creator of a shared data record, you can force the **synchronization** of dependent tables. You can find out the consequences and advantages of this [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/synchronisation-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes/).
