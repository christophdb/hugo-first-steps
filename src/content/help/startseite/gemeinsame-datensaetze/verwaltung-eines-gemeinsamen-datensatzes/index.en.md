Once you have created a common dataset, you can perform various operations to manage your data set. You can access the overview of your common datasets via the start page.

## How to manage your common datasets

1. Open the **home page** of SeaTable.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required"  text="You can only perform these management operations if you are the **creator of** the common dataset. The **three dots are hidden** for datasets that are only shared with one of your groups." />}}

## Retrieve details of a common dataset

If you use common datasets extensively in your team, it can be easy to lose track. With which **groups** is a common dataset shared and in which **bases** is it integrated? You can view this information under **Details**.

Enter the new name and confirm with **Send**.

## Manage access authorizations

You can use the **Manage access** option to share your common dataset with another group or withdraw access again. You can find out exactly how this works [here]({{< relref "help/startseite/gemeinsame-datensaetze/freigabe-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes-an-eine-andere-gruppe" >}}).

## Force synchronization with the common dataset

As the creator of a common dataset, you can force the **synchronization** of dependent tables. You can find out the consequences and advantages of this [here]({{< relref "help/startseite/gemeinsame-datensaetze/synchronisation-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes" >}}).

## Delete a common dataset

If you want to delete a common dataset, you will find all the important information [here]({{< relref "help/startseite/gemeinsame-datensaetze/loeschen-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes" >}}).
