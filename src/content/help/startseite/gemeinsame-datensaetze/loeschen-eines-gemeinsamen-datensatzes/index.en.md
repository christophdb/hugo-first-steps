If at some point you no longer need the **shared records** you have created, you can easily delete them from the home page at any time.

## Effects of deletion

- For any **tables** that use data from the deleted shared record, there is **no** longer a **synchronization option**.
- However, the **data of the common data set**, which are located in the corresponding tables to date, are **retained**.
