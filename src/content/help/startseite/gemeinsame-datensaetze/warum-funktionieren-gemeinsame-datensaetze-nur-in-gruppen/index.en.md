Common datasets can so far **only** be created from views of group bases. This is due to a **technical limitation** that may be removed in one of the future versions of SeaTable.

## Note by info text

This circumstance is also referred to by a short **info text** that appears as soon as you want to publish a common dataset from a table view of a base that does **not** belong to a group.

## Bypass limitation

To be able to create a common dataset from a table view of a base that does **not** belong to a group, there is a simple way around the technical limitation described above:

1. [Copy the corresponding base to any group.]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren" >}})
2. [Create a common dataset from the desired view.]({{< relref "help/startseite/gemeinsame-datensaetze/anlegen-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes" >}})
