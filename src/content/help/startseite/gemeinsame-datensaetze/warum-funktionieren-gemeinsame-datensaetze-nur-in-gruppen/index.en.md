Shared datasets can so far **only** be created from views of group bases. This is due to a **technical limitation** that may be removed in one of the future versions of SeaTable.

## Note by info text

This circumstance is also referred to by a short **info text** that appears as soon as you want to publish a common record from a table view of a base that does **not** belong to a group.

## Bypass limitation

To be able to create a common record from a table view of a base that does **not** belong to a group, there is a simple way around the technical limitation described above:

1. [Copy the corresponding base to any group.](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren/)
2. [Create a common record from the desired view.](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/anlegen-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes/)
