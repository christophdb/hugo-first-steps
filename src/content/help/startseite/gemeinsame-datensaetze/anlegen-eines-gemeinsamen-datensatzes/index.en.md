In each base belonging to a group, you can create a table view as a **common record**. The prerequisite for this is that you are the owner or administrator of the group (and not just a member). You can then import the shared record, including its specific filtering and sorting conditions, as a new table into any other base in the group.

{{< warning headline="No shared data records in private bases" text="Shared data records are only available in **Bases of a group** is available. In a private base, the function for creating a shared data record is grayed out." />}}
