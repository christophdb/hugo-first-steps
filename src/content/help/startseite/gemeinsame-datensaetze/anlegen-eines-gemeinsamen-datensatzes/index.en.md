In each base belonging to a group, you can create a table view as a **common dataset**. The prerequisite for this is that you are the owner or administrator of the group (and not just a member). You can then import the common dataset, including its specific filtering and sorting conditions, as a new table into any other base in the group.

{{< warning headline="No common datasets in private bases" text="Common datasets are only available in **Bases of a group**. In a private base, the function for creating a common dataset is grayed out." />}}

You will find all the common datasets that you have created and that have been shared with you on the start page under **common datasets**.
