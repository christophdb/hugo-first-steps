You can not only use shared data records in the respective group in which you created them, but also share them with other groups. In this way, other users have the opportunity to access the data of the shared data record. They are then able to work with the shared data record and create a new table. A shared data record is released to another group via the start page.

## Sharing a common data record with another group

Select the shared data record that you want to **share** with another group. 6. Click on the **three dots** to the right of the corresponding data record and then on **Manage access**. 7. Select a **group** to which the record should be released. 8. Confirm the release by clicking on **Add**.

## Dissolve release

To **cancel** the release of a shared data record to another group, simply follow the steps above again and click **Delete** next to the corresponding group in the access authorizations.

### Consequences of the dissolution

If a shared data set **is** released to another group, the **tables created** with the shared data set are retained in this group. The group is therefore **still** able to **work** with the existing data in the tables despite the dissolution.

However, the **synchronization option** with the shared data record is **no** longer available to the group once the share has been deleted, meaning that changes to the shared data record are **no** longer visible to this group. The members of the group therefore only have access to the last version of the shared data record **before** the share was deleted.
