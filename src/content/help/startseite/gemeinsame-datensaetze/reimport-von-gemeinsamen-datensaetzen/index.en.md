If you [copy]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren" >}}) **bases** into which common datasets are integrated or [restore them]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/wiederherstellung-eines-snapshots" >}}), the **connection to the common datasets** is lost. Although the data is then available in a normal table, it can no longer be synchronized. You can therefore **reimport** common datasets back into existing tables and thus enable **synchronization** with the data there.

## How to link a table to a common dataset again

![Reimport common dataset](images/Reimport-common-dataset.gif)

1. Open a **base** and select the **tab of the table** into which you want to reimport a common dataset.
2. Click on the triangular **drop-down icon** to the right of the table name.
3. Select the **Link to common dataset** option.
4. Select the **common dataset** to which you want to link the table.
5. Confirm with **Link**.

You can tell that the table is linked to the common dataset again by the **stack symbol** in the table tab.

## Consequences of reimportation

- Entries that are contained in the table but not in the common dataset are **deleted** from the table.
- Entries that are contained in both the table and the common dataset are **overwritten** in the table if changes have been made since the last synchronization.
- Entries that are not contained in the table but are contained in the common dataset are **added** to the table.
- Entries in added columns that are contained in the table but not in the common dataset remain **unchanged**.
