Within a SeaTable group there are three different roles: **Owner**, **Administrator** and **Member**. Depending on their role, which can be different from group to group, users are authorized to perform different actions. The following **table** provides you with an overview of what permissions each role has.

## Which groups and bases do you see?

Each user can only see the groups he is a member of. Groups and bases you are not a member of will not be shown to you, of course.
