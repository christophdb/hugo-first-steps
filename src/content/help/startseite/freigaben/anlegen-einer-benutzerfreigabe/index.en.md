If you are currently **in a Base**, you can also create a share without having to switch to the Home screen. To do this, click the **Share icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-share" >}} at the top right of the **Base options**. The window that opens to create a share looks just like the one on the Home page. Just follow the above clicking instructions starting from step 4.

## How to add multiple people at once

Follow the click instructions above to step 5. Click the {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-add\_members" >}} icon to **add people**.

## Permissions of the people with whom you have shared a base

A user who has been granted a share by you is **not an owner of the base** and **cannot**, for example, change the name of the base.

With a **read and write** share, the user can **see** and **edit** the contents of the Base. However, he **cannot** install **plugins** and **share** the base with other users and groups. Any changes made to the base are applied to all users with access.

If there is only a **read share**, the user cannot **edit** the contents of the Base. However, he has the **possibility to create a copy of the base** in order to make changes in the copied table. These are **not visible** for the users with access to the original Base.
