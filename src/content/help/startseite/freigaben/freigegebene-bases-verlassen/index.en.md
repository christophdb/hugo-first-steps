    title: 'Leaving Shared Bases in SeaTable: Step-by-Step Guide'
    description: 'Learn to leave shared bases in SeaTable and remove access—your prior changes remain in place, but you’ll lose further data access.'

If another user has shared a base with you, you can **leave this share**. This is possible at any time with just a few clicks via the start page.

## Leaving a shared base

![Exit shared bases](images/leave-shared-base.png)

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home page**.
2. Move the mouse pointer to the **base** and click the **three dots** that appear on the right {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-more-vertical" color="grey" >}}.
3. Click **Exit Share**.

## Impact

If you exit a share by yourself in the way described above, you **lose access to any data** in the shared base. However, **any changes** you made in base **before** exiting the share will still be **saved** in the base.
