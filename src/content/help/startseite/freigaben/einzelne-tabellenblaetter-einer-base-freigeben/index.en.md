You do not want to **share** a whole base, but **individual tables**? You can do this via a **custom share** to specific [users](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/anlegen-einer-benutzerfreigabe/) or entire [groups](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/eine-base-an-eine-gruppe-freigeben/).

## Share individual tables via the start page

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Move the mouse over the **base** from which you want to share individual tables.
3. Click on the **three dots** that appeared on the right.
4. Select the menu item **Release**.
5. A **window** will then open in which you can create various shares.

## Release within Base

If you are currently **in a Base**, you can also create a share without having to switch to the Home screen. To do this, click the **Share icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-share" >}} at the top right of the **Base options**. The window that opens to create a share is the same as on the Home page.

## Create custom share

For a detailed explanation of the necessary steps, see the article [Creating a Custom Share](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/benutzerdefinierte-freigabe-erstellen/).
