2. On the left side, click the **triangle icon to** the right of the **bases** workspace.
3. In the drop-down menu that now opens, you will now see your **groups** as well as the workspaces **My bases**, **Favorites** and **Shared with Me**.
4. To change the order of the groups, simply **drag and drop** any group to the desired position. To do this, use the **six dots** located to **the right of each group**.
