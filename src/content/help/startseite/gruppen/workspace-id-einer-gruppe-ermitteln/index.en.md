Each group in SeaTable has a so-called **workspace ID**. You need this ID to be able to make some [API calls](https://api.seatable.com). Here you can learn how to determine the workspace ID of a group via the browser.

## Determine workspace ID of a group

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click **any base of the group** whose **workspace ID** you want to determine.
3. When the selected Base has opened, you can read the **Workspace ID** at the top of the page **URL**.
