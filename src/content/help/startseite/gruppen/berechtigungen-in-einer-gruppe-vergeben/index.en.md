Within a SeaTable group, you can assign permissions by assigning a specific role to group members. You have to distinguish between the roles **owner**, **administrator** and **member**, which all have different [permissions]({{< relref "help/startseite/gruppen/gruppenmitglieder-und-ihre-berechtigungen" >}}).

It is important to note that only as the **owner** or **administrator of** a group, you can change the permissions of the other members. Here you will learn how to assign permissions in a group:

## Assign permissions in a group

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click the **triangle icon to** the right of the name of the group for which you want to assign permissions.
3. Go to **Manage Members**.
