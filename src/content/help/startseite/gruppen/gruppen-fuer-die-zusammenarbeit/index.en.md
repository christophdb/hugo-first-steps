    title: 'Groups in SeaTable: Team Collaboration & Access Rights Simplified'
    description: 'Manage projects together: Learn group roles, permissions and shared database access with SeaTable—plus overview of every group right in detail.'

**Groups** are particularly important for collaboration in your team. They bring together team members involved in common projects, allow easy sharing of data in common bases, and move user-managing functions directly into the group. The larger your team, the more often you should use groups.

Do you want to use groups for cooperation in your team? This article explains everything you need to know.

## Group roles

A SeaTable group can have an unlimited number of group members. However, the group members must be part of your team.

Each group member has one of the three roles: Owner, Administrator or Member. The user who creates a group is the group owner. He can add further group members and group administrators and change the permissions afterwards. A group always has only one owner, but ownership can be transferred. A group administrator has extensive management possibilities for the group and can appoint further administrators. However, a group administrator cannot delete a group or transfer ownership.

| Action         | Owner | Administrator | Member |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------ |
| Rename group   | Yes   | No            | No     |
| Transfer group | Yes   | No            | No     |
| Delete group   | Yes   | No            | No     |
| Leave group    | No    | Yes           | Yes    |
| Manage members | Yes   | Yes           | No     |
| Manage trash   | Yes   | Yes           | No     |

Each group member has write access to all group bases, i.e. the bases that belong to a group. A member can customize tables and create, modify, and delete entries in a group base. The access right of a group member also includes the permission to create web forms and install plugins.

| Action                   | Owner | Administrator | Member |

| Create group base        | Yes   | Yes           | No     |

| Delete group base        | Yes   | Yes           | No     |
