Owners and administrators of a group can add members, remove members, and change permissions of existing group members. In this article, you will learn the two ways to add team members to a group.

## Add team members directly

1. Go to the **home** page of SeaTable.
2. Click the **triangle icon to** the right of the group name.
3. Select the **Manage members** option.

6. Confirm with **Submit**.

{{< warning  headline=""  text="In the search field it is enough to enter only the first letters of the e-mail address or the name of another team member. SeaTable will automatically suggest you the matching team members." />}}

### What if you can't find the person?

If you do not find the person you are looking for, or more precisely, the autocomplete does not suggest the person you are looking for, it is most likely because this person is not part of your team. In this case, this other SeaTable user cannot be added to your group. Only with the help of an invitation link you can share a Base with this person and thus collaborate.

## Add team members in the Team administration

Team members with administrator rights also have the option of managing all groups and their members in the team administration. The advantage of the team administration is that you can change the group membership and the respective permissions at the same time.

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click your **avatar image** in the upper right corner and then click **Team administration**.

8. In the side menu that opens, switch to the **Members** tab.
9. Find the team members you want to add to the group.
10. Change the role from **None** to **Member** or **Admin** and **save** your changes.
