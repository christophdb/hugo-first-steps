You no longer want to receive **email notifications** about changes to bases and/or about collaboration (e.g. shared bases, comments)? No problem! In the **personal settings of** your account you can unsubscribe from them at any time in just a few steps.

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click your **avatar image** in the upper right corner to open the drop-down menu.
