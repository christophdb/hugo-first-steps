You want to change the **language** in SeaTable? No problem! You can change the interface language at any time in just a few steps via the **personal settings** of your account.

The **interface language** is the language in which SeaTable communicates with you and in which you interact with SeaTable on the user interface. This includes all preset labels, hints and menu options.

{{< warning  headline="Good to know"  text="**Not** affected by the language settings are all texts that you can write individually in SeaTable, for example comments, options of selection columns, entries in text fields or even names of bases, tables, views, columns, etc." />}}

## Customizing the interface language

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click your **avatar image** in the upper right corner to open the drop-down menu.
