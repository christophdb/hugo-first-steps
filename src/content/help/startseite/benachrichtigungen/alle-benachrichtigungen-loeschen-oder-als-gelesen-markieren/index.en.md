Notifications are an important part of collaboration in SeaTable and inform you, among other things, that automations have been triggered in your Bases, comments have been added to a row , or Bases have been shared with you. To help you keep track of notifications you receive, you can access them both from the Home screen and from within your Bases.

## Delete all notifications

Once you have taken note of all the notifications, you can simply delete them. To do this, proceed as follows:

![Open the notification center by clicking on the notification icon](images/notifications-in-base.jpg)

1. Open the **Notification Center** by clicking the **bell** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-notice" >}} at the top right of the page.
2. Click **Show all notifications**.
3. Click on the **three dots** next to the x symbol.
4. Select **Delete all notifications**.

## Mark all notifications as read

Marking notifications as read can be useful, for example, if you have taken note of notifications but do not want to delete them yet.

{{< warning  headline="Tip"  text="Provided you have enabled **email notifications** in the personal settings, you will receive a summary of all **unread notifications** by email on a regular basis." />}}

![Open the notification center by clicking on the notification icon](images/notifications-in-base.jpg)

1. Open the **Notification Center** by clicking the **bell** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-notice" >}} at the top right of the page.
2. Click **Show all notifications**.
3. Click on the **three dots** next to the x symbol.
4. Select **Mark all as read**.

## Access to the notifications

You can access notifications both from the SeaTable **home** page and from within **Bases**, and consequently mark your notifications as read or delete them in both ways. To do this, simply click on the **bell** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-notice" >}} at the top right of the page.

### Access via the home page

{{< warning  headline="Important note" >}}

Please note that it depends on the **content of** a notification where exactly it is displayed. For example, notifications about approvals are always displayed on the **home** page, while notifications resulting from [automations]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/die-kommentarfunktion-in-seatable" >}}) or [employee column entries](https://seatable.io/en/docs/datum-dauer-und-personen/die-spalte-mitarbeiter/) are displayed in the respective **Base**.
