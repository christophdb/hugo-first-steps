With the multitude of different topics that land on your desk every day, it can happen that you lose the overview in SeaTable: An **appointment** gets forgotten, a **feedback** from a colleague goes unnoticed or an important **change** is overlooked.

The **notification feature** is designed to prevent you from overlooking something important while collaborating in SeaTable, and can remind you of appointments before they are forgotten.

How to use the notification feature to keep **track of** your tasks and activity in SeaTable is the topic of this post.

## Notification function

SeaTable's notification feature allows you to automatically monitor **tables**, **views**, or just individual **columns**. Once set up, it ensures that specific users are informed via notification when a previously defined trigger event occurs.

With a clever, forward-looking configuration of **notification rules**, the time-consuming personal observation of a table is almost completely eliminated. You can set up a notification rule for one or more people. You can also have a notification sent that informs one or more other users, but not yourself.

{{< warning  headline="Access is necessary"  text="The prerequisite for notifying a user is that he has at least **read access** to the affected table." />}}

You can recognize the presence of a **new notification** by the **bell icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-notice" color="grey" >}}, which you can also use to open the notification center by clicking on it.

Please note that a notification is only a **hint within SeaTable**. A notification will only be sent to a user by **email** if they have set it that way in their personal settings.
