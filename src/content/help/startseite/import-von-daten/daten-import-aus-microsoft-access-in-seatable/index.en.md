In the following article you will learn how to import data from Microsoft Access to SeaTable.

## Data import from Microsoft Access

The most important information right at the beginning: A direct import of Microsoft Access files into SeaTable is currently **not** possible.

However, there is a small detour through which you can still import Access databases into SeaTable. Proceed as follows:

1. First, **export** the required tables from Microsoft Access as **CSV files**.
2. You can then **import** the CSV files exported from Microsoft Access **into SeaTable** as usual.
3. The steps required to import a CSV file from Microsoft Access are **identical to** [importing any CSV file]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/daten-import-mithilfe-von-csv-in-seatable" >}}).
