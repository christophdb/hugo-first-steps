SeaTable has a powerful import function to make it as easy as possible for you to **import data records from XLSX or CSV files**. In most cases, importing works without any difficulties. If you try to import too many records at once, SeaTable will warn you of the limit. While you can freely choose the **limits for file size and number of rows** on self-hosted SeaTable servers, SeaTable Cloud imposes certain limits on you.

## Maximum file size and number of lines for SeaTable Cloud

When importing Excel files, SeaTable supports this for files up to a maximum size of **100 MB** and up to **50,000 rows**. Due to these generous limits, you should never have problems with the file size. If you have a file that is larger or has more rows , you will need to split it into two **Excel files** and perform the import in two steps.

The normal SeaTable backend can hold a maximum of 100,000 rows per table. If you want to import an Excel or CSV file that contains more than 100,000 rows , you must first [activate the big data backend]({{< relref "help/base-editor/big-data/aktivieren-des-big-data-backends-in-einer-base" >}}) in order to be able to [import]({{< relref "help/base-editor/big-data/eine-excel-tabelle-ins-big-data-backend-importieren" >}}).

## Embedded graphics and files

Importing graphics and files via XLSX file is **not** possible. For such import you need to use SeaTable API, which allows you to import images and files without difficulties.

## Different file formats

The import function of SeaTable has been tested with files from **LibreOffice** as well as current files from **Microsoft Excel.** Other office programs (such as from the company Softmaker) are **not** actively tested, which may lead to different import results. If in doubt, use Microsoft Excel or the free LibreOffice to get the best results.
