You can create new bases in SeaTable not only empty or from a template, but also from a DTABLE file. DTABLE is the in-house [file format]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/dtable-dateiformat" >}}) used to export and save bases from SeaTable. Here you will learn how to create a base with a DTABLE file:

## Creating a base from a DTABLE File

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Depending on whether you want to create a new base from a DTABLE file in the **My bases** workspace or in a specific **group**, click **Add a base or folder** in the corresponding area.
3. Select **Import base from file (XLSX, CSV or DTABLE)**.
4. In the file overview that opens, select the desired **DTABLE file** from your device from which you want to generate the base.
5. Confirm the import either by **double-clicking** the corresponding file or by clicking **Select** or **Open**.

## Import problems with missing shares or permissions

Among other things, with **automations** and **common datasets**, problems can arise if the exporter of a DTABLE file has certain permissions or shares that another team member lacks.

For example, if a user imports a base without proper **permissions** and **shares**, they will **not** be able to access common datasets or run automations.
