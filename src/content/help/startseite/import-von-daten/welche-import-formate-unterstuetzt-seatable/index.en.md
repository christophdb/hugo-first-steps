SeaTable offers you a wide range of data collection options: you can manually enter data into tables and have data collected via [web form](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/webformulare/) or using automations.

In addition, SeaTable has a powerful data import. It can handle practically any Excel and CSV file. Via a small detour, the import of data from Microsoft Access and Google Sheets is also possible.

## Data import with CSV

CSV is a widely used data exchange format, which is often the lowest common denominator between two software products. Due to its simple structure, you retain full control over your data, but can import a **maximum of one table** or base at a time.

## Data import from Excel

Of course, when it comes to working with data, Excel can't be missing. SeaTable supports the import of both the new _XLSX_ and the old _XLS file formats_. Using Excel files, you can also import **multiple tables** or worksheets into a SeaTable Base at the same time. In doing so, SeaTable converts each worksheet from Excel into a table.

## Data import from Microsoft Access

Another source from which you can feed data into SeaTable is Microsoft Access.

## Data import from Google Sheets

You can also import data from Google Sheets into SeaTable.

## Data import with DTABLE

SeaTable Bases can be exported in [DTABLE file format](https://seatable.io/en/docs/expertenwissen/dtable-dateiformat/) - and with such a DTABLE file you can of course create a Base in SeaTable again.
