If you are still undecided about the design of your base or just looking for new inspiration, SeaTable gives you the possibility to quickly and easily create a base from a template.

## Creating a base Using a Template

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Depending on whether you want to create a base under _My bases_ or in one of your groups, click **Add a base or folder** in the corresponding area.
3. In the drop-down menu that opens, click **Create base from Template**.
4. Select **any template for** your base and click **Use Template**.
5. The **base** will now appear in the corresponding area on the home page and you can immediately start working in this base.

## Using a template directly from the SeaTable website

On [SeaTable's website in the Templates section]({{< relref "templates" >}}) you will find a variety of templates for different use cases. Each template offers you a preview of the table structure on the website, so you can quickly get a feel for how the base is built.

If you like a template and want to try it out, you can click **Use Template** to copy the template directly to your SeaTable Cloud in the **My bases** area. You will also jump directly into the base and can immediately start exploring it.
