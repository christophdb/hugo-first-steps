You can delete your **own bases** in SeaTable at any time. Bases that belong to a **group** can only be deleted as the owner or group administrator.

## Delete a base in SeaTable

![Delete a base in SeaTable](images/delete-base-via-starting-page.gif)

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Hover the mouse cursor over the **base** you want to delete.
3. Click on the **three dots** that appear on the far right.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. Confirm the operation again with **Delete**.

Deleted bases end up in a **recycle bin**. From there, you can first **restore** them. You can find out how to do this [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/eine-geloeschte-base-wiederherstellen" >}}).

{{< warning  headline="Attention"  text="After **30 days**, deleted bases are **automatically** removed from the system and **cannot** be recovered." />}}

## Empty the trash

If you don't want to wait until the 30 days have expired, you can also **manually** delete your own bases for good by **emptying** the **trash**.

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Open the **recycle bin** in the side menu, where you can now see your deleted bases.
3. Click the **Empty** button in the upper right corner.
4. Confirm the subsequent dialog with **Empty** again to remove all bases.
