To get a better overview of your Bases, you have the possibility to move individual Bases into folders and group them there, for example, by topic or content. In total, there are two ways to move a Base into a folder:

1. **Drag and drop** a base into a folder
2. Move a base to a folder via **context menu**

## Drag and drop a base into a folder

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click the **three dots** to the right of any **Base**.
3. Click **Move to Folder**.
4. Select a **folder of** the group to which you want to move the Base.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.

## Restriction

A Base can only be moved to a folder that belongs to the same **group** as the Base itself. If you want to move a Base to a folder of another group, you must first [copy](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren/) the corresponding Base to [the desired group](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren/).
