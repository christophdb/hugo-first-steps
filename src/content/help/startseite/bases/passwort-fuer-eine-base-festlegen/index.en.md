To protect your bases from unwanted foreign access, you can set any **password** for each base, which must be entered correctly by any user, including you, to open and subsequently edit the corresponding base.

This is especially useful for **group bases** that should not be accessible to all group members. bases in the **My bases** section are accessible only to you anyway. There, a password can be useful when you [share a base with a group]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/eine-base-an-eine-gruppe-freigeben" >}}).

## Set password for a base

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="For bases that belong to a **group**, only **owners** and **administrators** are allowed to set a password. Simple members will **not** see this option." />}}

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Hover the mouse over the **base** for which you want to set a password.
3. Click on the **three dots** that appear on the right.
4. Click **Set Password**.
5. Set a **password** for the base.
6. Enter the password **a second time** and confirm with **Submit**.

## Set password

After you click **Set password**, a window will open where you can set a **password with any number of letters, numbers or special characters**. Enter the password in the provided **field** and **repeat** it in the second field. If necessary, use the two options {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-eye-slash" >}} and {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-random-generation" >}} to the right of the first input field to **display** the entered password or generate a **random password**.

## Password protected base

Bases that are password protected are always marked with a **lock icon** on the home page.

To gain access to a password-protected base, **each** user must first enter the password correctly. For this purpose, a **window** opens automatically when trying to access the base, in which the **base password** must be entered.

As soon as you have entered the password for a base correctly, you have **access to** the base. Access is **maintained** even if you **leave** the base or **reload** the page. However, if you **close** the page completely, you will be asked to enter the base password **again** the next time you try to access the base.

## Change password

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="For bases that belong to a **group**, only **owners** and **administrators** are authorized to change the password." />}}

To change the base password, simply follow the way to set a password and click **Change** Password.

After you have clicked on **Change password**, a new **window** opens in which you can assign a new password for the corresponding base. To change the base password, you must also enter the **current password**. As soon as you confirm the change of the password with **Submit**, the newly set base password is active.

After you have successfully cancelled the base password, base can be opened again **without entering a password**. Therefore, base is **no longer** marked with a **lock icon** on the home page.
