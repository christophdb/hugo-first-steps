In SeaTable you have the possibility to duplicate your existing Bases. You can have the copy of your Base created either in one of your [groups](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-bases/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren/) or in the **My Bases** section. The latter works as follows:

![copy a base](images/duplicate-a-base.png)

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Move the mouse over one of **your Bases** and click on the **three dots**
3. Click **Copy**.
4. Select **My Bases**.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.
6. The **copy of Base** will now be displayed in your workspace.
