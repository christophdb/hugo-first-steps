In SeaTable you have the possibility to duplicate your existing bases. You can have the copy of your base created either in one of your [groups]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/eine-base-in-eine-gruppe-kopieren" >}}) or in the **My bases** section. The latter works as follows:

![copy a base](images/duplicate-a-base.png)

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home page**.
2. Move the mouse over one of **your bases** and click on the **three dots**
3. Click **Copy**.
4. Select **My bases**.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.
6. The **copy of the base** will now be displayed in your workspace.
