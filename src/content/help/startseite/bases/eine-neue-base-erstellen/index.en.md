    description: 'Learn how to create a new empty Base in SeaTable via start page or folder. Name it, set color & icon, and begin your workflow.'

In SeaTable you have the possibility to create a new empty base in the **My bases** workspace. You can also create a new base in one of your **groups** if you are the owner or administrator of that group. However, as a simple group member, you cannot create a new base in a group.

## Create a new empty base from the home page

![Create a new empty base from the home page](images/create-new-base-via-starting-page.gif)

1. Start from the **home** page of SeaTable.
2. In the appropriate workspace (My bases or one of your groups), click **Add a base or Folder**.
3. Then select **Create Blank base**.
4. Give the base a **name**, assign it a color and an icon and save the operation by pressing the **Enter key**.
5. The newly created base will now appear in the corresponding **workspace** on the Home **page**.

You can now fill your new base with **content** and build processes in it as you see fit.

## Create a base over a folder

Additionally, there is the possibility to create a new base via a folder.

1. Start from the **home** page of SeaTable.
2. Click a **folder** in the appropriate workspace (My bases or one of your groups).
3. In the window that opens, click **New** in the upper right corner.
4. Select whether you want to **create** an **empty base**, [import]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/datenimport-und-export" >}}#base_importieren) a base, or create a [base from a template]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/anlegen-einer-base-mithilfe-einer-vorlage" >}}).
5. Give the base a **name**, assign it a color and an icon and save the operation by pressing the **Enter key**.
6. The newly created base now appears in the folder overview and is stored in the corresponding **folder** on the start page.

You can now fill your new base with **content** and build processes in it as you see fit.

## Name restrictions

You can use virtually any name for your base. The name may contain **letters**, **numbers** and **special characters**, but it may not be longer **than 248 characters**. Currently, however, the two characters **slash** and **backslash** are not allowed. **Emojis** are also not allowed.
