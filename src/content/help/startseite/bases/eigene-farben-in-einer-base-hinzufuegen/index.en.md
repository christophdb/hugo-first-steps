With SeaTable you bring more color into your daily work - especially compared to drab databases and dull spreadsheets. With [Enterprise subscription](https://seatable.io/en/preise/) it is even possible that you insert **your own custom colors** via hexadecimal code into the color palette, which you encounter at various places within a base.

For example, you can colorize [selection options](https://seatable.io/en/docs/auswahlspalten/hinzufuegen-von-optionen-zu-einer-einfachauswahl-spalte/), [buttons](https://seatable.io/en/docs/andere-spalten/die-schaltflaeche/), and [cells](https://seatable.io/en/docs/ansichtsoptionen/einfaerben-von-zellen/) to match your corporate design, or let your creativity run wild with the color scheme.

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="**Only** **owners** and **administrators** can adjust the color settings of a Base that belongs to a group. Simple group members will **not** even see this option." />}}

{{< warning  headline="Note" >}}

Currently in SeaTable Cloud it is **not** possible to define your own color for a base (base header, [base icon on the home]({{< relref "help/base-editor/webformulare/webformulare" >}}). Here you can only choose from the default **12 colors**.
