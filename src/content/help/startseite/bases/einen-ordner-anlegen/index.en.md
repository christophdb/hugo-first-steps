For a better overview of your bases, you have the option to create new **folders** under **My bases** as well as under **Shared with Me** and in the individual **groups**. You can use the folders, for example, to store different bases for one topic. Here you can learn how to create a folder in SeaTable:

## Create a folder from the home page

![Create a folder from the home page](images/create-new-folder-via-starting-page.gif)

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Depending on whether you want to create a folder under **My bases**, **Shared with Me** or in a specific **group**, click **Add a base or Folder** in the corresponding area.
3. In the drop-down menu that opens, click **Create Folder**.
4. Give the folder any **name** and confirm it by clicking the green checkmark.
5. The **folder** will now appear in the appropriate section and you can fill it with [bases]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/allgemeines-zu-bases" >}}) as you wish.
   {{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="To create a folder within a **group**, you must be either **the owner** or **administrator of** the group. This function is **not** available to users who are only **members of** a group." />}}

## Create a folder in the folder overview

Besides the way described in the first section, you can also create a folder via the **folder overview**. This opens automatically in a new window when you click on an existing folder on the **start** page.

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
2. Click on an already existing **folder**.
3. In the window that opens, click **New Folder**.
4. Give the folder any **name** and confirm it by clicking the **green checkmark** or pressing the **Enter key**.
5. The folder will now appear both in the open **folder overview** and in the corresponding **section** on the home page, and you can fill it with bases as you wish.
   {{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="To create a folder within a **group**, you must be either **the owner** or **administrator of** the group. This function is **not** available to users who are only **members of** a group." />}}
