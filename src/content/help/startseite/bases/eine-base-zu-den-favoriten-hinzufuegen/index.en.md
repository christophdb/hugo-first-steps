To help you keep track of all the bases in SeaTable, individual bases can be favorited. Favorited bases appear under the **Favorites** section. Here you can learn how to add bases to favorites:

1. Switch to the SeaTable **home** page.
1. Hover the mouse over the **base** you want to add to the Favorites.
1. Click on the **three dots**.
1. Click **Add Favorites**.
1. The corresponding base is now automatically **marked with a star** and appears under the **Favorites** section.

## Favorites meaning

Bases that you have added to your **favorites** always appear at the **top of** your home page. The order of your bases and groups is always (from top to bottom):

- My bases
- Favorites
- Shared with me
- Group 1
- Group 2
- … (all your groups follow in any [order you can change]({{< relref "help/startseite/gruppen/die-reihenfolge-der-gruppen-aendern" >}})
