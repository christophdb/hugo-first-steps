## Favorites meaning

Bases that you have added to your **favorites** always appear at the **top of** your home page. The order of your bases and groups is always (from top to bottom):

- My bases
- Favorites
- Shared with me
- Group 1
- Group 2
- … (all your groups follow in any [order you can change]({{< relref "help/startseite/gruppen/die-reihenfolge-der-gruppen-aendern" >}})
