A webhook is always created for a base. Once the webhook is set up, any change to the contents of the base is sent to the target URL.

## Set up a webhook

1. On the SeaTable home page, hover over a base for which you want to set up a webhook.
2. Click the _Webhooks_ item in the context menu under _Advanced._
3. Enter a destination URL and confirm.
4. The webhook becomes active immediately.
