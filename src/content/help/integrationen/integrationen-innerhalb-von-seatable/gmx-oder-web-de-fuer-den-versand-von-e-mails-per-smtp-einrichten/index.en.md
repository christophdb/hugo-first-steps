The email services GMX and WEB.DE are very popular in German-speaking countries. You can use GMX and WEB.DE accounts to send emails from a SeaTable Bases.

This article explains how to set up a **GMX** or **WEB.DE** e-mail account in a SeaTable Base and what preparatory measures are necessary.

{{< warning headline="Identical procedure for GMX and WEB.DE" text="**GMX** and **WEB.DE** are offers from the German telecommunications provider 1&1. The procedure for integrating an email account in a SeaTable Base is demonstrated in this help article using GMX as an example. If you want to use a WEB.DE account, follow the instructions in the same way. The preparatory step must be carried out in the WEB.DE account settings." />}}

## Allow POP3/IMAP retrieval

By default, GMX and WEB.DE accounts can only be used via the webmailers or apps of the two providers. The retrieval and sending of emails with a third-party program such as Outlook, Thunderbird and SeaTable must be explicitly approved. You can do this in your account settings.

1. Log in to your **GMX e-mail account**.
2. Call up the **settings** for your account.

5. Activate **Allow POP3 and IMAP access**.
