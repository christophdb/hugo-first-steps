It may happen that you want to **temporarily prevent the use of an app** because, for example, you are making extensive changes to the underlying base. In this case, you can disable apps at any time with just a few clicks.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required in the group"  text="To be able to deactivate an app, you must be the **owner** or **administrator of the group** in which the underlying **base** is located. Simple **group members** are not authorized to do this." />}}

## Disable an app

1. Open the **base** where you want to disable an app.
2. Click **Apps** in the Base header.

4. Hover your mouse over the desired app and click on the **three dots** on the right.
5. Select **Pause** .

{{< warning  headline="Reactivate the app"  text="In the same way, you can reactivate inactive apps at any time." />}}

You can recognize a deactivated app by the note **(inactive)** after the name of the app.

## Consequences of deactivation

By deactivating an app, **you revoke access to all previous users**. They will no longer be able to see the app and will no longer be able to use it until you reactivate the app. Please note that you cannot [edit]({{< relref "help/app-builder/app-verwaltung/apps-bearbeiten" >}}) or [copy](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/apps-kopieren/) an inactive app.
