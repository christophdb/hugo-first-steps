You want to add an app to your base to tailor the work in SeaTable even more individually to specific user groups and use cases? No problem! This is done in just a few steps.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required in the group"  text="To be able to create an app, you must be the **owner** or **administrator of the group** in which the underlying **base** is located. Simple **group members** can only view and use existing apps." />}}

## Add an app to a base

1. Open any **base** where you want to add a new app.
2. Click **Apps** in the base header.

8. Confirm with **Submit**.

Once you have added the app, you can [edit]({{< relref "help/app-builder/app-verwaltung/apps-bearbeiten" >}}) and customize it to your liking.
