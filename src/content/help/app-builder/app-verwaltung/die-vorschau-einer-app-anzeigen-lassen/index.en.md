For optimal design of your apps, you should of course **test** them before publishing. To see your apps as users do, you can **preview** the current editing status at any time or simply **open** the apps in normal mode.

## Open an app

Basically, you can test your apps at any time by opening them in normal mode.

1. Open the **Base** in which you want to test an app.
2. Click **Apps** in the Base header.

4. Click on the **name of** the app to open it.

## Open the preview in Universal App Builder

You can also view the current status of your app at any time in the **editing mode** of the App Builder.

1. Hover your mouse over the Universal App and click the **pencil icon that** appears {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-rename" >}} to open it in edit mode.
