Apps that you have already added to one of your bases can be edited at any time using the tab of the same name in the base header.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required in the group"  text="To be able to edit an app, you must be the **owner** or **administrator of the group** in which the underlying **base** is located. Simple **group members** can only view and use the apps." />}}

## Edit an app

1. Open the **Base** in which you want to edit an app.

6. The selected app will open in edit mode, where you can make certain **settings** .

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="To be able to edit your apps, you must always open them in **edit mode**. You can **only** access this in the way described. If you simply click on the **name of** your app, you will open your app in the **preview** and will therefore **not** be able to edit it." />}}
