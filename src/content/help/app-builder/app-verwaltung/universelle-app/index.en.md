When building a **Universal app**, you can let your creativity run wild. The app has a number of [page types](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/seitentypen-in-der-universellen-app/) that allow you to present your data in the form of **tables**, **web forms**, **galleries** or **kanban boards**, among others. By [creating](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/seiten-und-ordner-in-einer-universellen-app-anlegen-und-verwalten/) a **custom page**, you can create dashboards with meaningful **statistics** from your data that you can share with other (external) users.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required in the group"  text="To be able to create, edit, copy or delete an app, you must be the **owner** or **administrator of the group** in which the underlying **base** is located. Simple **group members** can only view and use existing apps." />}}

## Creating the Universal App

In order to use a Universal App in your Base, you must first **add** it to your Base.

[Learn how to add a Universal App to your Base here.](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/apps-zu-einer-base-hinzufuegen/)

## Design of the Universal App

After you have successfully created your universal app, you can start designing it. Make sure to always use the **pencil icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-rename" >}} to enter the [editing mode of]({{< relref "help/app-builder/app-verwaltung/apps-bearbeiten" >}}) the app.

A Universal App consists of several **pages** that you can group into **folders**.

[Learn how to add new pages and folders to your Universal App here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/seiten-und-ordner-in-einer-universellen-app-anlegen-und-verwalten/).

To prepare the data in your Base in an appealing way, the Universal App offers a variety of [page types](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/seitentypen-in-der-universellen-app/) with different design elements.

## Preview of a Universal App

When designing a universal app, you'll want to test how the app looks to users in between. To do this, you can simply [preview](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/die-vorschau-einer-app-anzeigen-lassen/) the [app](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/die-vorschau-einer-app-anzeigen-lassen/) in Edit mode.

## Change settings of a universal app

Within a Universal App, you can make various **global settings**. For example, you can change the **name**, **color**, and **URL of** your app. You can make the desired adjustments with just a few clicks via the **app settings**.

## Saving versions of a universal app

The **version management** of each app offers you the option of saving snapshots of the structure of an app. You can find out how to create an app **snapshot** [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/universelle-apps/versionsverwaltung-und-snapshots-einer-universellen-app/). Please note what an app snapshot saves - and what it does not save.

## Page permissions in a universal app

To precisely control access to your data, you can set **individual page permissions for** **each page** you have added to a Universal App. Editing page permissions is always done through the **page settings**, which you can access via the gear icon {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}}.

![Open the page settings](images/page-permissions-universal-app.png)

[Learn more about the different page permissions in the Universal App here.](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/seitenberechtigungen-in-einer-universellen-app/)

## User and role management of a universal app

Add new users, create and assign roles - in the **user and role management of** a Universal App you can perform various administrative activities.

[Learn more about the user and role management of the Universal App here.](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/benutzer-und-rollenverwaltung-einer-universellen-app/)

## Share a Universal App

You can also share a universal app with other users via the [user and role management](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/benutzer-und-rollenverwaltung-einer-universellen-app/). To do this, simply generate an individual **invitation link** or use a **QR code**.

## Copy a Universal App

Have you built a universal app that you would like to use in a similar form for another user group? Then just copy the existing app and customize the copy as you like. You can learn how to copy a Universal App [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/apps-kopieren/).

## Disable a Universal App

If you've created a Universal App that you want to temporarily disable, you can disable it with just a few clicks to revoke access to all user groups. You can find out how to do this [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/apps/apps-zeitweise-deaktivieren/).

## Delete a Universal App

You can **delete** a universal app that you no longer need at any time. Please note the consequences of the deletion.

## No collaborative work in universal apps

While the universal app has many advantages over [working in the](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-bases/bases/) base, there is a big difference if you want to work on the data together in a team. In a base, every change made by other users is displayed immediately. The entries change in real time. This type of collaborative work is not supported in the Universal app.

## Comments in universal apps

Nevertheless, you also have the option of communicating with other team members in an app. To do this, use the [comment function]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/zeilen-kommentieren" >}}) that you already know in the same form from Base. Record your feedback or additional information on the data records for the other app users and hold discussions on the spot.

![Comment function in universal apps](images/Kommentarfunktion-in-Universellen-Apps.png)

{{< warning  headline="Good to know"  text="The comments in the app are completely **independent** of the comments in the base. This means that every comment in the app is only visible where it was posted - not in the base and not in other apps, even if it is the same data record." />}}
