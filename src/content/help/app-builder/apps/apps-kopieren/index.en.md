You have built a sophisticated **app** that you want to use in a similar way for another user group? Then simply **copy** the existing app and customize the copy as you see fit.

{{< warning  headline="Authorization required in the group"  text="To be able to copy an app, you must be the **owner** or **administrator of the group** in which the underlying **base** is located. Simple **group members** are not authorized to do so." />}}

## Copy an app

1. Open the **Base** where you want to copy an existing app.
2. Click **Apps** in the Base header.

4. Hover your mouse over the app and click the **copy icon that** appears {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-copy" >}}.
