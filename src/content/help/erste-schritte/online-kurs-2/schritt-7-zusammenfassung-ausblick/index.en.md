Congratulations! You have now created a solid framework with which you can efficiently manage your course offering. Let us briefly summarize what you have now achieved:

- You can clearly record and manage your courses.
- Participants can register for courses via a web form.
- You always have an overview of which courses are fully booked and which are still available.
- Sie können den Zahlungsstatus Ihrer Teilnehmer nachverfolgen.
- By sending e-mails to participants (registration confirmations, payment requests, participation confirmations), you have the entire course process under control.

## The road to success: step by step

It is important to emphasize that working with SeaTable becomes particularly efficient when you focus on the essentials. Here are two essential tips to help you work successfully and purposefully:

### Tip 1: Start as simply as possible

When digitizing processes, there is often a tendency to implement everything perfectly and comprehensively down to the smallest detail. But in many cases, overly complex solutions tend to lead to problems. It is better to optimize the core process first. In your case, this could be the process from course registration to payment collection. Once this core process works reliably, you can gradually add extensions.

A helpful approach is to sketch the process visually - for example with a simple process drawing. This could look like the following:

1. Create course offer
2. Provide registration form
3. Sending a request for payment
4. Enter incoming payments
5. Confirmation of receipt of payment
6. Conduct course
7. Send confirmation of participation

### Tip 2: Test regularly

Changes and adjustments are often necessary to optimize your workflow. However, every change carries the risk that existing processes may stop working unexpectedly. You should therefore test the entire process after each adjustment to ensure that everything continues to run smoothly. This applies in particular to important views, forms and automations. Lock critical views or give them descriptive names to avoid misunderstandings.

## Outlook: More automation and new possibilities

The next step on your journey with SeaTable offers exciting opportunities to further automate and professionalize your processes.

- **Online course part 3**: The next course will focus primarily on the topics of **collaboration and App Builder**. You will learn how to create your own app with SeaTable, how to work together in a team and how to make your processes even more user-friendly with just a few simple steps.
- **Automations**: You have already sent emails by button. With an Enterprise subscription, you could fully automate these and many other processes. Emails, status changes and many other tasks could then be carried out without any manual intervention. This way, administration runs on autopilot and you can concentrate fully on your course.
- **Payment integration with Stripe**: Instead of manual transfers, you can add a direct Stripe payment integration. Participants then pay immediately online and the payment is automatically recorded in SeaTable. A connection with a tool like [n8n](https://n8n.io) can easily realize this integration and seamlessly automate the entire payment process.

With these extensions, you have the opportunity to further professionalize your system and make it even more efficient. Get ready for part 3, in which we will delve deeper into automation and integration. Good luck on your future journey!
