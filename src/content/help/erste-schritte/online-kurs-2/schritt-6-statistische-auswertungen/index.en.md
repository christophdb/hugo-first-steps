We are nearing the end of this second online course. While the process for your customers is complete with the receipt of the confirmation of participation, you can take one more step: analyzing the data you have collected. This provides an excellent basis for statistical evaluations that will help you to make your services better and more successful.

With SeaTable, you can create charts and graphs in seconds that provide you with answers to questions like these:

- How much turnover did I make in which month?
- How many registrations have I received per month?
- Which course is particularly popular?
- Which participants have booked more than one course?

## The statistics module in SeaTable

Open the statistics module in your Base and you will see that we have already prepared some charts to answer the first three questions. These charts show you, for example:

- **Sales per month**: At a glance, you can see that June and August 2024 were the months with the highest sales, while August 2024 recorded the most registrations.
- **Registrations per month**: Here you can see in which months your courses were particularly popular.
- **Popular courses**: You will receive an overview of which courses have been booked particularly frequently.

## Create a diagram yourself

If you want to visualize the fourth question - "Which participant has booked more than one course?" - you can easily visualize it yourself. At the top right of the statistics module, click on `{{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-add-table" >}} Add chart` and explore the various options. Here you can filter by participants and display the number of bookings.

## Automatic updating of the charts

A big advantage of the statistics module in SeaTable is the automatic update. As soon as you have created a chart, it will always access the latest data in your base. Manual updating is not necessary - the charts are continuously calculated with the latest figures.
