In the introduction, we have already pointed out that you must have access to a SeaTable system and ideally have an account in our community forum in order to complete this online course.  
In this article, we would like to briefly explain these two aspects.

If you already have a SeaTable and Forum account, you can skip this part and [jump]({{< relref "help/erste-schritte/online-kurs-1/navigieren-in-der-benutzeroberflaeche-von-seatable" >}}).

## SeaTable Server

Let's start with access to a SeaTable server. There are three ways to get one:

### 1st SeaTable Cloud

By far the easiest way is to register a free account for the SeaTable Cloud. Registration only requires an e-mail address and is completed in a minute.

[Register now for free]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}})

### 2\. seaTable Server

Alternatively, with our [SeaTable Server](https://admin.seatable.io/) we offer you the option of installing SeaTable on your own server. However, we can only recommend this to advanced users with technical knowledge of Docker .

### 3\. SeaTable Dedicated

The third option is our SeaTable Dedicated. With this premium offer, which we offer to teams of 100 users or more, we install your individual and private cloud, which you and your team can access under any domain. We also take over the maintenance of this system, so you don't have to worry about a thing. At the same time, we offer you the opportunity to customize your system to your individual needs. This can be done using custom logo, your own colors, individual templates or your own limits.

## SeaTable Community Forum

Our [community forum](https://forum.seatable.com) is an important communication channel for everyone who wants to use SeaTable. On the one hand, we regularly publish news about SeaTable as well as tips and tricks for efficient use. At the same time, you have the opportunity to post in the forum if you have questions or problems with SeaTable. A third aspect that should not be neglected is the direct exchange between SeaTable users. Many users willingly share their experiences and successes with others.

Registering for the Community Forum is very easy. At https://forum.seat [able.io/signup](https://forum.seatable.com/signup) you will find the registration form, which only requires your name, e-mail address, user name and a password. You will then receive an e-mail with an activation link. As soon as you have confirmed this, you can become active in the forum. Please make a note of your user name, as you will need it at the start of the quiz.

In any case, we recommend that you register in our forum, as the successful completion of the quiz at the end of this online course will automatically assign the corresponding badge to your forum account.
