You have probably already entered a few expenses in your new expense management system. However, we need a little more data for the following steps. We will therefore remove your existing entries and import new data records into the table.

## Delete the old data records

Switch to your table `Expenses` and delete all previously entered rows. Your table should now be empty.

## Import of new data records

SeaTable offers a wide range of import options. You can import entire bases as .dtable, .csv or .xlsx files. But even if you already have a base, you can write new or updated data directly into a table. This is exactly what we want to do now using a CSV file. Alternatively, we could also have used an Excel file here.

- Download the following [expenses.csv](/expenses.csv) file
- Now import the CSV file into the table `Expenses`
- Check that the table now has exactly 50 entries

## Import and export

Of course, you can export data, tables and bases in SeaTable just as you can import them. Just play around with the various options to get a feel for these functions. However, exports are not important for the rest of this course.

That's all for this part. Let's move on to the next step.
