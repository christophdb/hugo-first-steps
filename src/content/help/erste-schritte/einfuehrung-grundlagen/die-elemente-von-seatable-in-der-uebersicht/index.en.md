### The home page with your bases

After logging in, you start on the home page of SeaTable. Each square tile represents a project, database or process of yours. SeaTable calls these objects "bases". bases contain all the information you need for a particular project or data collection, much like a folder that contains individual files.

### Tables

Each base consists of one or more tables. Tables help you to structure and relate your information.

### rows

Each row represents a related record in your table. For example, if you are compiling a directory of people, each person gets a row with all their data.

### Columns

With the columns of your spreadsheet you define which information is stored there in each case. Unlike a classic spreadsheet like Excel, you can't override the column type and simply store any information at any location.

If a column is a [number column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-zahlen-spalte" >}}), you can also store only numbers in that column. SeaTable knows a lot of different column types, so you can capture all the data you want.

### Views

Views allow you to look at the same information from different angles. The underlying rows are always the same, but using filters, sorting, grouping, hiding, and conditional formatting, you can create your own individual views of the data that is relevant to you. Normally, all team members share the same views within a base. However, you can also create private views that are visible only to you.

### Plugins

In addition to the views, plugins offer further possibilities to display the data in a base in the optimal way. The gallery is ideal for a base with many images, the timeline has its strengths for entries with start and end dates and the Kanban board lets you easily change the status of entries. Plugins help you work efficiently and effectively with your data.

## Work in a team

### Groups

You use groups to determine which team members have access to individual or multiple bases. Each team member should have access only to the bases relevant to their work. Most teams in SeaTable create groups for individual work areas such as HR, marketing, management, or product development. This allows you to control access easily and effectively.

### Authorisations

### Cooperation

SeaTable is a solution where people should work together on processes, structures and data. Only by working together as a team do you unleash the true potential of SeaTable.

### Team administration

The Team administration provides various functions for the administrators of your team. Among other things, you can manage your team members and subscription, view invoices or create support tickets.

### Subscription and billing

Each team has either a Free, Plus or Enterprise subscription. This subscription determines how much data the team is allowed to store together and which features are available to the team.
