SeaTable is, depending on who you ask, always something different: For project managers SeaTable is a flexible **project management tool**, for developers it is a reliable **bug & issue tracking system** and for marketing specialists it is a clear **editorial plan**, a **survey software** or a **data analysis tool**. Teams use SeaTable as a **collaboration platform**, individuals as a **to-do list** or to manage **collection objects**. And these are just a few of the countless use cases.

From a technical perspective, it is easier to say what SeaTable is: an **AI no-code database with an integrated app builder**. As a collaborative database application with an intuitive tabular interface, SeaTable looks like a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel) at first glance. It also offers corresponding functions, but the possibilities go far beyond those of a classic spreadsheet. This can be seen, for example, in the **linking of tables**, the creation of **apps** or the use of **automations** and **artificial intelligence**.

When you use [SeaTable Cloud]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-cloud" >}}), everything happens on the web. A browser is all you need to use SeaTable. No download, no program installation, no configuration – just register with your e-mail address in a few seconds and you're ready to go. If you install [SeaTable Server]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-server" >}}) on your own servers, you retain full data sovereignty.

## SeaTable ...

### ... organizes all your data

SeaTable gives you complete freedom to organize your data. Some spreadsheets only understand text, numbers and formulas. SeaTable does not have these limitations.

You can store text-based information in SeaTable in the same way as **images and files**. **Single selection columns** allow clear categorization, **multiple selection columns** allow quick keywording. **Digital signatures**, **geolocation data**, **references to persons** and other column types allow you to combine all data in one place.

But SeaTable not only offers richer format support through [over 25 column types]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/uebersicht-alle-spaltentypen" >}}). As a database application, SeaTable also supports relations between data sets of different tables, which results in a wide range of application possibilities that are unimaginable in spreadsheets.

### ... displays your data the way you need it

Once you get used to SeaTable's versatile **visualizations**, you'll never want to be without them again:

Easy-to-use [views]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/was-ist-eine-ansicht" >}}) ensure that you always have exactly the data you need at a glance. Thanks to [Calendar]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/die-kalender-ansicht" >}}), [Gallery]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/die-galerie-ansicht" >}}) or [Kanban]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/die-kanban-ansicht" >}}) views, you can see your data from completely different angles.

In addition, SeaTables provides you with various [plugins]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/alle-plugins-in-der-uebersicht" >}}), such as [Organigram]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-organigramm-plugin" >}}), [Tree]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-tree-plugin" >}}) or [Map]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-karten-plugin" >}}) provide completely new display options to optimally support your work. And with various statistics, you can visualize your data analyses quickly and easily.

For example, a first click shows the dates of an event on a calendar, a second click shows the accompanying images in a gallery and a third shows the event locations on a map. You will never want to do without this again.

### ... makes teams even stronger

You **work together and in real time** on all the things you organize in SeaTable. New entries and changes are immediately displayed for each user – you and your team are always on the same page.

Do you want to make a comment on a row? Then simply leave a [comment]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/zeilen-kommentieren" >}})! This way, it's always clear what you're talking about and even months later you don't have to think about when, where and via which channel you discussed it with your colleagues.

[Sharing bases, tables and views]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/base-und-ansichtsfreigaben-im-ueberblick" >}}) with other users or entire groups can be done in no time at all. By assigning individual user authorizations, you retain control over who is allowed to do what and who is not allowed.

Sharing is not limited to other SeaTable users: You can also share data with [external links]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/externer-link-erklaert" >}}) or [invite]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/einladungs-link-erklaert" >}}) people without a SeaTable account to collaborate directly in SeaTable.

### ... is a survey and analysis tool in one

You don't always have to enter data yourself. SeaTables [web form editor]({{< relref "help/base-editor/webformulare/webformulare" >}}) creates an online survey or an extended contact form based on a table in no time at all.

You define relevant fields, dependencies, notifications etc. in the graphical design mode of the web form. Once the data collection is complete, the data is analyzed directly where it was saved: in SeaTable.

### ... is the backend for your apps

With SeaTable's intuitive App Builder, you can create any number of [Apps]({{< relref "help/app-builder/app-verwaltung/welche-apps-gibt-es" >}}), i.e. individual front ends for specific user groups, from your database backend. In the [Universal app]({{< relref "help/app-builder/app-verwaltung/universelle-app" >}}) you can give free rein to your creativity.

SeaTable has a range of page types that you can use to display data in the App Builder in the form of tables, forms, calendars or galleries, among other things. By creating [custom pages]({{< relref "help/app-builder/seitentypen-in-universellen-apps/individuelle-seiten-in-universellen-apps" >}}), you can also build dashboards with meaningful statistics from your data and share them with other (external) users.

### ... combines the power of a database with automation and artificial intelligence

As a powerful database, SeaTable is also made for dealing with [big data]({{< relref "help/base-editor/big-data/potenzial-big-data" >}}), which puts it ahead of other no-code platforms. SeaTable also allows the use of [automations]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/uebersicht-ueber-automationen" >}}) and artificial intelligence, which unfold immense potential in large amounts of data.

### ... you can integrate seamlessly and expand indefinitely

Turn 1 + 1 = 3 by linking SeaTable with other applications and integrating it into other solutions. Thanks to the REST API, this is no challenge. Processes can be automated and standardized with [scripts]({{< relref "help/skripte/allgemein/unterschied-zwischen-javascript-und-python-scripten-in-seatable" >}}).

If you want to develop your own scripts and plugins without restrictions, SeaTable's Realtime SDK provides you with everything you need. We look forward to seeing what you build for SeaTable!
