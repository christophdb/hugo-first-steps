SeaTable is always something different, depending on who you ask: for project managers SeaTable is a flexible **project management tool**, for developers it is a **bug & issue tracking system** and for market researchers it is a **survey software**. Agencies use SeaTable as a **collaboration platform**, collectors as an **archiving solution**. And these are just a few of the countless use cases addressed.

It is clearer from a technical perspective what SeaTable is: **a collaborative database application with an intuitive spreadsheet interface**. Data entry is therefore simple as in a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel), but the possibilities go far beyond those of a classic spreadsheet.

With SeaTable, everything happens on the web. A browser is all you need to use SeaTable. No download, no program installation, no configuration - registering with your email address takes less than 15 seconds and you're ready to go.

## SeaTable ...

### ... organizes all your data

SeaTable gives you all the freedom to organize your data. Excel, for example, only understands text, numbers and formulas. SeaTable does not have these restrictions.

You can store text-based information in SeaTable just like images and files. Single selection fields allow for unique categorization, multiple selection fields for quick tagging. Barcodes, geo-location data, references to people and other field types make it possible for you to combine all data in one place.

And SeaTable not only offers richer format support with [over 20 column types]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/uebersicht-alle-spaltentypen" >}}). As a database application, SeaTable supports relations between records of different tables, resulting in a wide range of applications not imaginable in Excel.

### ... displays your data as you need it

Once you get used to SeaTable's wide range of analysis features, you will never want to miss them:

Easy-to-use [views]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/was-ist-eine-ansicht" >}}) ensure that you always have exactly the data you need in view - and with various statistics you can visualize your evaluations quickly and easily.

Moreover, with SeaTables different [plugins]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-karten-plugin" >}})) you get completely new display options to support your work in the best possible way.

For example, a first click puts the dates of an event on a calendar, a second click shows the accompanying pictures in a gallery, and a third shows the event locations on a map. You'll never want to do without this again.

### ... makes teams even stronger

You work **together and in real time on** all the things you organize in SeaTable. New entries and changes are immediately displayed to each user - you and your team are always on the same page.

You want to make a comment on a row ? Then simply leave a [comment](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-zeilen/die-kommentarfunktion-in-seatable/) there! That way, it's always clear what you're talking about, and even months later you don't have to think about when, where and via which channel you exchanged ideas with your colleagues.

[Sharing bases, tables and views](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/base-und-ansichtsfreigaben-im-ueberblick/) with other users or entire groups is a snap. By assigning individual user permissions, you retain control over who can do what and who cannot.

Sharing is not limited to other SeaTable users: You can also share data with [external links](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/externer-link-erklaert/) or [invite](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/einladungs-link-erklaert/) people without SeaTable account to collaborate directly in SeaTable.

### ... is analysis and survey tool in one

You don't always have to enter data yourself. SeaTable's [web form editor](https://seatable.io/en/docs/webformulare/webformulare/) will create you an online survey or an advanced contact form based on a table in no time.

You define relevant fields, dependencies, notifications, etc. in the graphical design mode of the web form. Once the data collection is complete, the evaluation of the data takes place directly where it was saved: in SeaTable.

### ... you can integrate seamlessly and expand indefinitely

Turn 1 + 1 = 3 by linking SeaTable to other applications and integrating it into other solutions. Thanks to the [REST API](https://docs.seatable.io/published/seatable-api/home.md), this is no challenge.

Processes can be automated and standardized with [scripts](https://seatable.io/en/docs/javascript-python/unterschied-zwischen-javascript-und-python-scripten-in-seatable/).

If you want to develop your own scripts and plugins without restrictions, SeaTable's Realtime SDK provides you with everything you need. We are excited to see what you build for SeaTable!
