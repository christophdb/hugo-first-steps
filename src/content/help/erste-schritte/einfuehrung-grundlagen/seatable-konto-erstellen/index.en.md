## The registration

1. Open the [SeaTable website]({{< relref "/" >}}).
2. Click **Register** in the upper right corner.

At SeaTable Cloud, every team always starts with the free subscription. That's why you don't need to provide any payment information. Of course, you can [upgrade]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/plus-oder-enterprise-abonnement-buchen" >}}) your team to a [Plus or Enterprise subscription]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/plus-oder-enterprise-abonnement-buchen" >}}) immediately after the first login.

## Choose a password and invite team members

After clicking on the link in the email, you will be taken to a web page that will help you create your account and team. First of all, you will have the opportunity to set a password and choose your team name.

After that, if you want, you can invite other team members and specify in which area you will work with SeaTable. Suitable templates will be suggested to you, which you can import directly into your account.

That's it. We wish you a lot of fun with SeaTable.
