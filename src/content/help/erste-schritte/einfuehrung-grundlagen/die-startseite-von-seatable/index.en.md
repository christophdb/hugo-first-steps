After you have registered and logged in, you will be taken to the SeaTable home page. In this article we will break down the different sections to help you navigate to the different areas of the product.

![Elements of the SeaTable home page](images/elements_seatable_homepage.png)

## Header

The header of the home page contains four elements. These are:

- **SeaTable logo** - click to refresh the home page.
- **Search field** - allows searching for one or more bases by their names.
- **Bell** - displays general [notifications]({{< relref "help/startseite/benachrichtigungen/sinn-und-zweck-von-benachrichtigungen-in-seatable" >}}).
- **Avatar** - opens a menu: The current team limits are displayed here, as well as links to the [personal settings]({{< relref "help/startseite/persoenliche-einstellungen" >}}) and the [team settings]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/die-funktionen-der-teamverwaltung-in-der-uebersicht" >}}) if you are a team administrator. The logout is also located here.

## Page navigation

The left side navigation of the Home page contains links to various sections and resources like [bases]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases" >}}) and [Trash]({{< relref "help/startseite/papierkorb" >}}). You will also find links to this User Guide and the [templates]({{< relref "templates" >}}) available to you within SeaTable.

## Workspace

The workspace contains all the bases you have access to. The workspace is divided into the following sections:

- **My bases** - bases that you have created and to which only you have access (as long as you do not give any [shares]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/base-und-ansichtsfreigaben-im-ueberblick" >}}) ).
- **Favorites** - bases that you have marked as [favorites]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/eine-base-zu-den-favoriten-hinzufuegen" >}}).
- **Shared with me** - all the bases that others have shared with you.
- **Groups** - all the [groups]({{< relref "help/startseite/gruppen" >}}) you are a member of.
