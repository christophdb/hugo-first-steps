## Is SeaTable free of charge? Can I test the Plus or Enterprise subscription?

The Free subscription is basically free for everyone and already offers you a wide range of features and possibilities. In addition to the Free subscription, SeaTable also offers two paid subscriptions, the Plus and Enterprise subscriptions, which provide you with additional features and greater limits in working with your data. In general, we offer companies the possibility to test SeaTable Enterprise for free for 30 days to try out the additional features for themselves.

## How team members influence subscription costs

SeaTable requires a license for each user, who has his own login. A SeaTable subscription includes a collective license that is not bound to the individual user.

[Learn more about how team members affect subscription costs](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/wie-teammitglieder-die-abonnementkosten-beeinflussen/).

## How are inactive users taken into account in billing?

To use SeaTable in your team, a license must be purchased separately for each user.  
However, users who no longer use the program can be set to inactive via the "Team" tab in the team administration and will then no longer count in the number of booked users.

[Learn more about accounting for inactive users](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/wie-werden-inaktive-user-bei-der-abrechnung-beruecksichtigt/).

## Read-only access because limits reached?

If you have exceeded your subscription limits, SeaTable will only grant you read-only access to your data and you will not be able to edit it until you switch to a subscription package that grants you more extensive limits than your current subscription. The same applies when you switch to a lower subscription package.

[Learn more about read access to your data when you exceed your subscription limits](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/was-tun-wenn-man-die-abo-limits-ueberschritten-hat/).

## What to do if you have exceeded the subscription limits?

If you have exceeded the limits available to you in your current subscription, you must either switch to a more extensive subscription package or delete part of your data until the limits in question are no longer exceeded.

[Learn more about what you can do if you exceed your subscription limits](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/was-tun-wenn-man-die-abo-limits-ueberschritten-hat/).

## Cancel the subscription

Existing subscriptions can be cancelled at any time via the team administration. Please note, however, that a cancellation of your subscription only takes effect at the end of the term and can still be used in full until that time.

[Learn more about canceling your subscription](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/das-abo-kuendigen/).

## What happens to my data if I delete my team?

If you, as a team administrator, delete your team, your account, your team and all data contained therein will be permanently and permanently deleted. As far as possible, all data stored about you will also be deleted from our systems. This process **cannot** be reversed and the deleted data CANNOT be recovered.
