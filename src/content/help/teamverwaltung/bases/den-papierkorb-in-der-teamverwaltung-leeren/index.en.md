After **30 days**, deleted bases are **automatically** removed from the system. However, you can also permanently delete the bases **manually** by **emptying the trash in the team administration**.

1. Click your **avatar image** in the upper right corner.
2. Select **Team administration** from the drop-down menu.
3. In the **Navigation**, go to **Bases** and then to **Trash**

4. You now see the overview of all already deleted bases of your teams. You can now restore individual bases or completely empty the trash.
