## The trash

All **deleted bases** are listed in the recycle bin. After **30 days**, the bases are automatically removed from the system. However, you can also **delete all** bases in the recycle bin manually. You can find out how to do this [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/den-papierkorb-in-der-teamverwaltung-leeren/).

To restore a base, click the respective base and operate the slider before clicking the **Restore Base** button.
