SeaTable currently offers two payment methods:

- Payment by credit card
- Payment by invoice

Payment by **credit card** is the payment method that is used in the vast majority of cases. Thanks to our payment service provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com), we accept payments by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, China UnionPay, Discover, Diners and Cartes Bancaires.

The second possible payment method is **payment** by invoice, which is only possible under certain conditions. You can find out what these are in the help article [Payment by invoice]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/bezahlung-per-rechnung" >}}).

## How can I see which payment method is currently being used?

1. Open the **Team administration**.
2. Click on **Subscription**.
3. You can view your current payment method under "**Payment method"**.

![In Team Management, you can view, change, and delete your stored credit card.](images/payment-method.png)

## How can I change my payment method?

At the same place where you can see your payment method in Team Management, you can also edit it. Click on **Edit Payment Method** and make the desired changes.

You can, for example, store a **new or additional credit card** as the payment method.

## Switch to Invoice Payment

Learn how and under what conditions you can activate **invoice payment** in this [article]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/bezahlung-per-rechnung" >}}).
