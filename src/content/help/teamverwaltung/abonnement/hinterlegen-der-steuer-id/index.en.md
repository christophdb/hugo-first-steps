## Automatic check of the tax ID

After submitting the form, your tax ID will be automatically checked and compared against the address you provided. The check may take several minutes.

Only when the verification has been successful, the tax ID will be effective and used on future invoices. Also, the preview of the future invoice amount will not be adjusted until the tax ID has been verified as valid.
