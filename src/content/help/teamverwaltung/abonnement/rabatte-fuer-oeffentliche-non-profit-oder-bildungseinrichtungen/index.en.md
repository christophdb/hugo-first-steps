Would you like to use SeaTable and are you a registered association, work in a public institution or a charitable non-profit organization? Then you will enjoy special benefits because we want to support people who work for the common good - be it through social work, humanitarian aid, ecological projects or education and research.

SeaTable grants public institutions a 25% discount, charitable non-profit organizations and educational institutions receive a standard 50% discount and local associations in exceptional cases even up to 75% discount on their SeaTable Plus or SeaTable Enterprise subscription. To take advantage of the discount, simply submit a corresponding request via the [team administration](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/die-funktionen-der-teamverwaltung-in-der-uebersicht/).

## Request discount

If you have not yet registered a team on cloud.seatable.io, start by [registering]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}}). Always create a team with the free [subscription](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/abo-pakete/) first. Then proceed as follows:

1. Open the [team management](https://account.seatable.io).
2. Switch to the **Subscription** section.
3. Click on **Are you a non-profit organization?**

## Wait for feedback

Please give us one to two days to review your request. A SeaTable representative will then contact you. If we grant you the discount, you can simply upgrade your account via the team administration and the discount will be applied immediately.
