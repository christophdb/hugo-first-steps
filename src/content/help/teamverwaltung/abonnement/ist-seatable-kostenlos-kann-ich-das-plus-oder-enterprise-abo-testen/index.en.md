SeaTable Cloud, SeaTable's online offering, is basically free for everyone to start with. We call this our **free subscription**, with which every team is created.

For this reason, you don't need to provide a credit card when registering. Your email address is perfectly sufficient for you to start using SeaTable right away. Even with the free version, almost all features are available to you and your team and you already have to store a lot of data in SeaTable to hit either the rows- or storage limit. You can find out what those limits are on our [pricing page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).

Here are some things you and your team can do with SeaTable Free:

- Create as many bases as you like and collaborate on your data.
- Define views to enable each team member to work optimally.
- Use our plugins to visualize your data.
- Share your work with others with the help of a share link.

## When will SeaTable become chargeable?

In addition to Free, SeaTable has two other paid subscriptions. An upgrade to one of the paid subscriptions becomes necessary if you either need a feature that is not included in Free, or you reach the rows- or memory limit. For example, automations, advanced permissions and various visual customizations are only available in the Plus or Enterprise subscription. You can see the prices for the different subscriptions and the features and options included in each subscription package on our [pricing page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).

## Can I try Plus or Enterprise for free?

Basically, we offer companies the possibility to test SeaTable Enterprise for 30 days free of charge in order to be able to try out the additional features for themselves. For such a request we offer a corresponding form in [the team administration in the subscription section.](https://account.seatable.io/subscription)
