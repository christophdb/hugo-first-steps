In SeaTable, your team is the center of attention. You work together on your tasks and projects. In the team you celebrate successes, experience setbacks and develop your potential. In this article you will learn how to manage your team via the **team administration** and what you can do there.

You manage your team including all users, groups and bases in [SeaTable's team administration](https://account.seatable.com). Your **subscription** is also linked to your team, whether you have a **free** subscription or a paid **Plus** or **Enterprise** subscription. You also manage your subscription in the team administration.

{{< warning  headline="Access for administrators only"  text="Team administration is accessible only for **team administrators**." />}}

A team can have several administrators, who will then have access to the following areas in the team administration:

## Team members and groups

This section provides an overview of your team's team members and groups. You can add and delete **team members** as well as edit their membership and roles in groups. **Groups** can also be managed and members and bases of a group can be viewed. In addition, you will also find general settings here. For example, you can change the name of the team or enable mandatory **two-factor authentication for all team members**.

## Bases and shares

Within the team administration, you can see all **bases of** your team members and track who has an **access permission to** which bases. In addition, you can monitor and restrict sent [invitation]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/einladungs-link-erklaert" >}}) links and [external links]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/externer-link-erklaert" >}}) and see whether the links grant read or write permissions and how often they have been accessed.

As a team administrator, you also have the option of manually [emptying the trash]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/bases/den-papierkorb-in-der-teamverwaltung-leeren" >}}) in addition to automatic deletion after 30 days.
