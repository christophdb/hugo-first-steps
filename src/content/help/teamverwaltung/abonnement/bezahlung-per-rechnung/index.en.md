    title: 'Invoice Payment in SeaTable Enterprise: Requirements and Activation Steps'
    description: 'Learn how to pay your SeaTable Enterprise subscription by invoice – only for annual plans, at least 10 users, easy setup in team admin and direct bank transfer.'

SeaTable currently offers two payment methods for purchasing a paid subscription. **Credit card** is the payment method used in most cases. Thanks to our payment service provider Stripe, we accept payments via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, China UnionPay, and Cartes Bancaires.

Payment by **invoice**, on the other hand, is only possible under certain conditions. You can find out what these are in this article.

## Requirements for Payment by Invoice

- You are signing up for a new **Enterprise subscription** for your team.
- Your team has a minimum size of **10 team members**.
- The subscription term chosen is annual, meaning the cost for **one year is paid in advance**.

If these requirements are met, you can select payment by invoice. This option is only available during the initial purchase of a new paid subscription.
After that, you will receive an invoice from us asking you to transfer the amount due to our German bank account.

## Payment by Invoice for Existing Subscriptions

If you already have a paid subscription, the **payment by invoice** option will not be displayed.

Please [contact us]({{< relref "pages/contact" >}}) if you meet the requirements and would like to switch to **payment by invoice** afterward.
