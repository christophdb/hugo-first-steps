SeaTable currently offers two payment methods for booking a Plus or Enterprise subscription. The **credit card** is the payment method that is used in the vast majority of cases. Thanks to our payment service provider Stripe, we accept payments via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, China UnionPay and Cartes Bancaires.

Payment by **invoice**, on the other hand, is only possible under certain conditions. You can find out what these are in this article.

## Requirements for payment by invoice

- You sign up for an **Enterprise subscription for** your team.
- Your team has a minimum size of **10 team members**.
- Annual subscription is selected as the term, so that the costs for **one year** are paid in **advance**.

If these requirements are met, you can activate payment by invoice at any time in the team administration. This is possible both when initially booking a new paid subscription and if you already have a paid subscription.

Afterwards you will receive an invoice from us with the request to transfer the invoice amount to our German bank account.
