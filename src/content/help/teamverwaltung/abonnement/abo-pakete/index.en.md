We offer SeaTable in different versions in different price ranges - so there is something for everyone. The features and capabilities vary depending on the price level and are therefore fully customizable to your individual needs. You can get a quick comparison of our subscriptions on [our price page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).

## Subscription packages for SeaTable Cloud

### SeaTable Cloud Free

The Free subscription to SeaTable is free - [just register]({{< relref "pages/registration" >}}) and get started! Included in the free version are unlimited tables, a total of up to 10,000 rows and 2 GB storage space for files within the tables. Versioning is possible one month backwards. This means that tables can be restored up to 4 weeks retrospectively. With the Free version you can write unlimited JavaScripts and use up to 100 Python runs.

### SeaTable Cloud Plus

The Plus subscription offers unlimited tables, up to 50,000 rows and 50 GB of storage for files in your bases for 7€ per month per user. Versioning extends up to 6 months and Python runs increase to 5,000 with unlimited JavaScript remaining the same. New additions include extended shares, which is especially important when working in a team. The shares allow flexible management of tables and make it easier for you to coordinate data - share bases and tables individually with employees and customers so that everyone sees only what they should.

### SeaTable Cloud Enterprise

With SeaTable Enterprise, for 14€ per month per user, you get unlimited tables and rows, a full 100 GB of storage for files and 12 months of versioning for recovery. Also unlimited are the JavaScripts and Python runs. With Enterprise you can expect additional sharing options, extended customizing of your bases and the archive function. In addition, there are automations that can efficiently relieve you of a lot of work.

## Your own SeaTable system

### Dedicated Cloud

With Dedicated Cloud you get your own personal offer: If you don't want to store your data in a public cloud, you can use SeaTable with 100 users or more through your own server, which we manage and maintain. This gives you absolute control over your server in terms of URL, logo, color scheme and templates. In the Dedicated Cloud, you also get an Enterprise Admin Panel, Single Sign-On via SAML2 and OAuth, and optional Corporate Support. You can [find out more]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-dedicated" >}}) here.

### SeaTable Enterprise License

Of course you can purchase a SeaTable Enterprise license from us. With this license you can easily build and run your own SeaTable server.  
More information about the SeaTable license can be [found here]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-server" >}}).
