    title: 'How Inactive Users Affect Billing in SeaTable'
    description: 'See how inactive users in SeaTable require no license and are excluded from your total billed user count—manage team costs easily.'

---

To use SeaTable in your team, a license must be purchased separately for each user.  
However, users who no longer use the program can be set to **inactive** via the **Team** tab in the team administration and will then **no** longer count in the number of booked users.

Alternatively, you can simply use this link:  
(you must of course be logged into cloud.seatable.io)

[To the team administration](https://account.seatable.com/team)

## Set User to Inactive

Locking team members (i.e. setting their status to Inactive) is described in the help article [Lock or Delete a Team Member]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/ein-teammitglied-sperren-oder-loeschen" >}}).

## Inactive Team Members Don't Require a License

Deactivated users always appear in the Team overview under the **Team** tab with a red **Inactive** notice.

![Inactive users don't affect the total number of booked users](images/inactive-users.png)

Inactive users **don't require a license** and don't increase the total number of booked users.
