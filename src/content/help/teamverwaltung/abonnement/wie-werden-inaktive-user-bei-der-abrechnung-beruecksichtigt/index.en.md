To use SeaTable in your team, a license must be purchased separately for each user.  
However, users who no longer use the program can be set to **inactive** via the **Team** tab in the team administration and will then **no** longer count in the number of booked users.

Alternatively, you can simply use this link:  
(you must of course be logged into cloud.seatable.io)

[To the team administration](https://account.seatable.io/team)

## Set user to inactive

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="Users can be set to inactive by team admins **only**." />}}2. Open the **Team administration**. 3. Click on **Team**. 4. Click on any **user**. 5. **Activate** the **slider** next to the **"Disable user"** item. 6. Click **Save Changes**.

Deactivated users always appear in the Team overview in the **Team** tab with a red note **Inactive**.

Inactive users do **not** need **a license** and do not increase the total number of booked users.
