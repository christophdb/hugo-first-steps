If you have exceeded the limits available to you in your current subscription, you basically have two options to get back to working fully with your data:

- Switch to a more comprehensive subscription package
- Delete part of your data

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="An overview with all available packages and the limits, functions and possibilities they contain can be found on our [pricing page](https://seatable.io/preise/)." />}}

## Switch to a more comprehensive subscription package

To get back to working fully with your data, you will need to [upgrade your subscription](https://seatable.io/docs/abo-abrechnung/plus-oder-enterprise-abonnement-buchen/) to a more comprehensive subscription package.

## Delete part of your data

If you don't want to switch to a more extensive subscription package, your only option is to **delete** parts of your data until you **no** longer reach the limits of your current subscription. The following help articles can help you with this:

- [Delete a Base](https://seatable.io/docs/arbeiten-mit-bases/loeschen-einer-base/)
- [Empty the recycle bin in the team administration](https://seatable.io/docs/teamverwaltung/den-papierkorb-in-der-teamverwaltung-leeren/)
- [Delete a table from a base](https://seatable.io/docs/arbeiten-in-tabellen/loeschen-einer-tabelle-aus-einer-base/)
- [Delete a row]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/das-loeschen-von-zeilen" >}})
