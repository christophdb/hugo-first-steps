If you have exceeded the limits available to you in your current subscription, you basically have two options to get back to working fully with your data:

- Switch to a more comprehensive subscription package
- Delete part of your data

{{< warning  headline="Note" >}}

An overview with all available packages and the limits, functions and possibilities they contain can be found on our [pricing page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).

## Switch to a more comprehensive subscription package

To get back to working fully with your data, you will need to [upgrade your subscription]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/plus-oder-enterprise-abonnement-buchen" >}}) to a more comprehensive subscription package.

## Delete part of your data

If you don't want to switch to a more extensive subscription package, your only option is to **delete** parts of your data until you **no** longer reach the limits of your current subscription. The following help articles can help you with this:

- [Delete a base]({{< relref "help/startseite/papierkorb/loeschen-einer-base" >}})
- [Empty the recycle bin in the team administration]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/bases/den-papierkorb-in-der-teamverwaltung-leeren" >}})
- [Delete a table from a base]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/loeschen-einer-tabelle-aus-einer-base" >}})
- [Delete a row]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/das-loeschen-von-zeilen" >}})
- [Data import and export]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/datenimport-und-export" >}})
