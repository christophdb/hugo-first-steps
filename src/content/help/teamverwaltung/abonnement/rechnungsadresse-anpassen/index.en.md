## Frequently asked questions about the billing address

{{< faq >}}

When does the billing address become valid?|||

If you change your billing address, all future invoices will be created with your new billing address.

---

Can the billing address be changed retroactively?|||

Unfortunately no. Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the billing address on invoices that have already been generated. In exceptional cases, we may be able to issue you a new invoice, but will charge a processing fee of 10 â‚¬ in any case. Please send us an appropriate [support request](https://account.seatable.io/support) with the invoice number and the exact change requests.
