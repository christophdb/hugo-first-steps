[Locked team members]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/ein-teammitglied-sperren-oder-loeschen" >}}) can no longer log in and work with you. However, as a **team administrator**, you can unlock them.

## No login for deactivated team members

When a locked or disabled team member tries to log in to SeaTable, the following error message is displayed:

![Lock member's account error message in LogIn](images/Fehlermeldung-Account-sperren.png)

At this point, the team member can no longer do anything on his own.

## Unlocking by the team administrator

1. Switch to the **team administration**.
2. Click on the **Team** menu item.
3. Select the blocked **team member**.
4. Turn off the **Disable user** slider.

As soon as you make the change **Saved at** the team member can log back into the SeaTable Cloud or request a new password.
