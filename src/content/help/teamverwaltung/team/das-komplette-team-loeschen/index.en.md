By confirming the deletion, you immediately trigger the following actions:

- Your team with all its team members will be deleted.
- All bases and data contained in them will be deleted.
- Your subscription, if you have one, will be deleted.
- Your data will be removed from our payment system Stripe as much as possible. However, if invoices have been generated, Stripe may not delete your account completely.
