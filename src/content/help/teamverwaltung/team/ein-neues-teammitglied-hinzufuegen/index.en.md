As a **team administrator**, you can create new team members via the **team administration** without them already being registered with SeaTable. During the creation you can already assign your new team member to first groups and make security relevant settings. Your new team member will then receive his or her **access data by e-mail** and can start working with you immediately.

## Add team members

1. Click on your **profile** in the upper right corner.
2. Select the **Team Management** option from the drop-down menu.
3. Click on the **Team** menu item under **Navigation**.
4. Click the **Add Team Member** button.
5. A new window will open. Set the **user name**.
6. Enter the **email address of** the person you want to add as a team member.
7. Set your **own password** or generate an **automatic password** by leaving the input blank.
8. Select the **language** in which you want the email to be written.
9. Click **Add Team Member**.

{{< warning  headline="Attention"  text="You **cannot** add a **team member** who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**. In order to create an account with this email address, this user must back up all their data (e.g. [export](https://seatable.io/en/docs/historie-und-versionen/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei/) as a [DTABLE file](https://seatable.io/en/docs/historie-und-versionen/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei/)) and delete their previous account. You can find out more about this in the article [Can two SeaTable accounts be merged?](https://seatable.io/en/docs/haeufig-gestellte-fragen/kann-man-zwei-seatable-konten-zusammenfuehren/)" />}}

## Other options when creating a team member

You can set the following **security options** by activating the corresponding sliders:

- Decide if you want your new team member to become an **administrator of** the team.
- Decide if you want your new team member to go through **2-factor authentication**.

Under the **Groups** tab you can select the respective groups and determine the role your new team member should have in the group: **none**, **member** or **admin**. Selecting one of the last two options will add the new team member to the groups.
