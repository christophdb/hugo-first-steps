As a **team administrator**, you can create new team members via the **team administration** without them already being registered with SeaTable. During the creation you can already assign your new team member to first groups and make security relevant settings. Your new team member will then receive his or her **access data by e-mail** and can start working with you immediately.

## Add team members

{{< warning  headline="Attention" >}}

You **cannot** add a **team member** who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**. In order to create an account with this email address, this user must back up all their data (e.g. [export]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei" >}}) as a [DTABLE file]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei" >}})) and delete their previous account. You can find out more about this in the article [Can two SeaTable accounts be merged?]({{< relref "help/haeufig-gestellte-fragen/probleme/kann-man-zwei-seatable-konten-zusammenfuehren" >}})

### Security Options

You can additionally set the following **security options**:

- Decide whether your new team member should become a **Administrator** of the team.
- Decide whether your new team member should undergo **2-Factor Authentication**.

### Group Membership

In the **Groups** section, you can select the respective groups and determine the role your new team member should have in the group: **none**, **Member**, or **Admin**. Selecting one of the last two options adds the new team member to the groups.
