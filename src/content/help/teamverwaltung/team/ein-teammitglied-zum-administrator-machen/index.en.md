6. Click **Save Changes**.

## The rights of a team administrator

Every team administrator gets **full access to** the team administration and has the **same rights**. For a detailed overview of all team administration functions, please read the article [The team administration functions]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/die-funktionen-der-teamverwaltung-in-der-uebersicht" >}}) at a glance.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="You can make team members administrators only if you are a team administrator yourself. You can **revoke** administration rights using the same slider you used to grant them." />}}
