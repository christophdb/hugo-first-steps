As a team administrator, you can add new members to the team and **give** these members **administration rights** as well.

## Make team members administrators

![Make a team member an administrator](images/Ein-Teammitglied-zum-Administrator-machen.gif)

1. Click on your **profile** in the upper right corner.
2. Select the **Team administration** option from the drop-down menu.
3. Go to the **Team** menu item under **Navigation**.
4. Click the **team member** you want to give administration rights to.
5. A new window opens. Under **Security**, activate the **Administrator** slider.
6. Click **Save Changes**.

## The rights of a team administrator

Every team administrator gets **full access to** the team administration and has the **same rights**. For a detailed overview of all team administration functions, please read the article [The team administration functions]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/die-funktionen-der-teamverwaltung-in-der-uebersicht" >}}) at a glance.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="You can make team members administrators only if you are a team administrator yourself. You can **revoke** administration rights using the same slider you used to grant them." />}}
