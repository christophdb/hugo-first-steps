You don't know why data is missing from a base and suspect that it has been lost? Don't worry. In SeaTable there are several ways to recover deleted data.

First check if a [filter]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/ausblenden-und-verschieben-von-spalten" >}}). These data are **not deleted**, but **only hidden**.

If this is not the case, next look at the [activity log]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/historie-und-logs" >}}) on your home page. There you can see changed and deleted data of the last 7 days across all your bases.

If you or your team members have accidentally deleted certain items in SeaTable, you can restore them in several ways.

## Restore tables, columns and rows from base trash

You can restore entire tables or individual columns and rows at any time via the trash in a base.

Learn more about restoring tables, columns and rows[here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/eine-geloeschte-tabelle-wiederherstellen" >}}).

## Restore deleted bases from the trash

Deleted bases can be restored via the trash on the start page. Please note that this is only possible until the 30th day after the deletion.

Learn more about base recovery [here]({{< relref "help/startseite/papierkorb/eine-geloeschte-base-wiederherstellen" >}}).

## Restoring data via the base log

SeaTable logs all activities within a base in a log. This log can be used to restore not only individual values, but also rows, columns and tables.

Learn more about recovering data via the base log [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/aenderungen-ueber-die-logs-rueckgaengig-machen" >}}).

## Restore snapshots

If you regularly take snapshots of a base in SeaTable, you can restore it as a new base at any time.

Learn more about restoring snapshots [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/wiederherstellung-eines-snapshots" >}}).
