You want to [add a user to your team]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/ein-neues-teammitglied-hinzufuegen" >}}), but get the error message that this account already exists? This is the solution:

You cannot add a team member who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**. In order to create an account with this email address, this user must back up all their data (e.g. [export]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei" >}})) and delete their previous account. You can find out more about this in the article [Can two SeaTable accounts be merged?]({{< relref "help/haeufig-gestellte-fragen/probleme/kann-man-zwei-seatable-konten-zusammenfuehren" >}}))
