    description: 'With limit exceeded, base is read-only. Delete data or upgrade your plan to regain full access and continue editing, importing or adding rows or files.'

You have **read-only access to** your bases and cannot add any more data? Then you have reached a **limit in your subscription**. Don't worry, your data is safe, you just can't edit it anymore until you increase your subscription limits or free up space.

## Possibilities in case of exceeded limits

To be able to further edit your bases and add data, there are basically two different options available:

1. **Delete** part of your data (bases, tables, groups, etc.) to free up storage space until your limits are no longer exceeded. A **Overview** about the memory limits you are currently using can be found in the drop-down menu on the home page.

2. [Switch to a subscription]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/abonnement/aktuelles-abo-aendern-paket-laufzeit-und-teamgroesse-anpassen" >}}) that gives you higher limits.

For a detailed overview of all available **subscriptions** and the features, capabilities and limits available to you with them, please visit our [pricing page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).
