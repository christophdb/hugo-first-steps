You want to **delete** the first column of your table and wonder why you don **'t see** the necessary option in the column settings? No need to worry, this is intentional and has a specific reason, which we will explain to you in this article.

## The special features of the first column

The fact that you cannot **delete** the first column of a table is due to the important function of this column. It is based on the **primary key** in relational databases and is also used in SeaTable to **designate a record**. For this reason, the first column of a table has several **special features** compared to the other columns, one of which is the property of not being able to be deleted.

You will learn all other peculiarities of the first column in the article [The peculiarities of the first column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/die-besonderheiten-der-ersten-spalte" >}}).

## What if I want to use a different first column?

If you want to use another column as the first column, you can [adjust]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/hinzufuegen-einer-spalte" >}}) and simply [copy-and-paste]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/hinzufuegen-von-daten-per-copy-and-paste" >}}) the data from the previous first column into the new column.
