The SeaTable Cloud does **not currently allow users to change their email address**. Neither the user nor the team administrator can change the email address of an existing account. However, this is possible **by** creating a **new account** with a **new email address** and deleting the existing account. This procedure is described in the following article.

## Migration as team administrator to a new team

If you are the **administrator** or the only person in your team, changing your email address is very easy. **Export** all your existing bases as **DTABLE files**, create the **new account with a new email address**, import all bases into the new account and delete your **old** account. Here you can find the appropriate help articles:

- [Exporting a Base as a DTABLE File]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei" >}})
- [Registration](https://seatable.io/en/docs/erste-schritte/seatable-konto-erstellen/)
- [Creating a Base from a DTABLE File]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/erstellen-einer-base-aus-einer-dtable-datei" >}})
- [Delete the complete team](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/das-komplette-team-loeschen/)

## Migration within a team to a new e-mail address

This process is also very simple. First, create **another team member with the new email address**. Give this team member administrator rights at the same time. Next, create a **group**, add the new team member to this group and copy all his existing **bases** into this group. Now change the account and **delete the original user**. The following help articles will help you with this:

- [Add a new team member](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-neues-teammitglied-hinzufuegen/)
- [Make a team member an administrator](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-teammitglied-zum-administrator-machen/)

- [Lock or delete a team member](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-teammitglied-sperren-oder-loeschen/)

## Migration without team administrator rights

Even if you do not have administrator rights in your team, the procedure is basically the same. However, you will need the **support of your team administrator** at some points, for example, when it comes to creating a new team member or deleting your previous account.
