You can have a link sent to your SeaTable account email address that will allow you to reassign your password. You can find this function on the login page of SeaTable Cloud.

## To reset your password

1. Open the [login page of](https://cloud.seatable.io) SeaTable.
2. Click **Forgot password?** and a new window will open.
3. Enter the **email address** you used to create your account and confirm with **Submit**.

Shortly you will receive an email with a link. With this link, generated individually for you, you can **reset** your **password**.
