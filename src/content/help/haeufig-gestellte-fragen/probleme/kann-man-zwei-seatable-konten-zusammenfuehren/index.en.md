Unfortunately, it is **not possible** in the system to merge individual SeaTable accounts or to transfer people from one team to another team. Therefore, you **cannot** add a **team member** who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**.

## Merging possible via a detour

Of course, you can delete an account (team or team member) at any time and then create a new one in another team. The following procedure is recommended for this:

1. [Export all bases]({{< relref "help/startseite/bases/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei" >}}) that you want to transfer to the new team.
2. [Delete the team member]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/ein-teammitglied-sperren-oder-loeschen" >}}) or [the entire team]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/das-komplette-team-loeschen" >}}) via the team administration.
3. Create a [new team member]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/ein-neues-teammitglied-hinzufuegen" >}}) in the other team.
4. [Import]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/erstellen-einer-base-aus-einer-dtable-datei" >}}) your previously exported bases.

## Deactivate is not enough

Deactivating the team member in the original team is not sufficient. For SeaTable to use the email address again, you must delete the team member completely.

If you [delete the entire team]({{< relref "help/teamverwaltung/team/das-komplette-team-loeschen" >}}), all other team members will be deleted as well.
