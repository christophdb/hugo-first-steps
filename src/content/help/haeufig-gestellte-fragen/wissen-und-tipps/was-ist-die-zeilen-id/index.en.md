The **rows-ID is the unique identifier of a row**, which, unlike the numbering by views, cannot be changed. You typically need the rows-ID when writing **scripts** in JavaScript or Python.

## Read the rows-ID from the URL

1. Move the mouse to the numbering at the beginning of the row.
2. Open the **row details** by clicking on the **double arrow icon**.
3. Once the new window has opened, you can see the rows-ID from the **URL**: **row-id='rows-ID'**

## Read row ID using a formula

The **formula column** allows you to display the IDs of all rows at once. The formula **rowid()** returns the ID of each row. This can then be used, for example, in button actions or automations.
