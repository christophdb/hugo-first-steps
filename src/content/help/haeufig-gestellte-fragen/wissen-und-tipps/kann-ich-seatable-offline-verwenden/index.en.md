**SeaTable Cloud** is a service that you access via the Internet. Access without an Internet connection is not possible.

Alternatively, you can run your **own SeaTable server**. You can access it via your local network and without internet access.

## SeaTable Cloud is a SaaS product

SeaTable Cloud is and will always be a Software-as-a-Service product. This means SeaTable Cloud is a web platform that you access with your browser over the Internet. Offline access to SeaTable Cloud is currently not possible.

However, there is of course the possibility that you export your data to access it offline. SeaTable gives you the option to export records via CSV or Excel. Alternatively, you can use the SeaTable API or another integration to export your data to another system.

{{< warning headline="Pay attention to what is exported" text="A data export via CSV or Excel does not include comments, files, automations and rows- and table descriptions. Reconciliation with exported data may present certain challenges." />}}

## You can use your own SeaTable server without the Internet

The situation is different if you run your own SeaTable server on your local network. A self-hosted SeaTable does not require Internet access. In this case, you can also access your platform and your data offline via the local network.
