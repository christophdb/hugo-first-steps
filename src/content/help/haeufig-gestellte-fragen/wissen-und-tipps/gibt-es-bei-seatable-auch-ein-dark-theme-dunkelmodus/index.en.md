Unfortunately no. SeaTable Cloud does not currently offer a dark mode. However, it is not excluded that we will offer one in the future.

Users of a self-hosted SeaTable server have the possibility to configure a permanent dark mode using individual CSS definitions in the system administration. However, this certainly requires a few hours of work and a good understanding of CSS.
