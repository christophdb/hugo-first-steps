You have read-only access to your data and can no longer edit it? Don't worry, your data is safe. You have probably only reached your **limits** available to you in your current **SeaTable subscription**.

{{< warning headline="Note" >}}

For a detailed overview of all available **subscription packages** and the features, options and limits available to you with them, please visit our [pricing page]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}).

## How can I edit my data again?

In order to continue to fully edit your data, you will need to **switch to** a **subscription package** that grants you **more extensive limits** than your current subscription. The steps required for this can be found in detail in this [help article on upgrading your account](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/plus-oder-enterprise-abonnement-buchen/).

Alternatively, you can delete part of your data until you fall below your current limits again.

## Subscription change and limits

Please also note that your **limits** may also be reached if you switch your subscription to a **smaller subscription package**. If the volume of your data exceeds the limits included in the newly booked subscription after switching from **Enterprise to Plus** or from **Plus to Free** , you may only have **read access to** your data. Consequently, they will no longer be able to edit your data until you switch back to a **more extensive subscription package** or you delete some of your data.

Therefore, **before** switching to a lower subscription package, please make sure that your data does **not** exceed the limits of the newly booked package. You will also receive a **notice** from SeaTable before confirming a subscription change in the team administration.
