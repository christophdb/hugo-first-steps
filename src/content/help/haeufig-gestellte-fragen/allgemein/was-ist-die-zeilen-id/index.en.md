The **rows-ID is the** **unique identifier of a row**, which, unlike the numbering by views, cannot be changed. You typically need the rows-ID when writing **scripts** in JavaScript or Python.

## Read the rows-ID from the URL

1. Move the mouse to the numbering at the beginning of the line.
2. Open the **line details** by clicking on the **double arrow icon**.
3. Once the new window has opened, you can see the rows-ID from the **URL**: **row-id='rows** -ID **'**

## No determination of the rows ID per formula

Currently, the **formula column** does not offer the possibility to read out the rows ID.
