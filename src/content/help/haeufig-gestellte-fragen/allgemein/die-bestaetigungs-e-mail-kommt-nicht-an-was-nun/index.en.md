You have not received a confirmation email for your registration with SeaTable? No need to worry! Just follow the steps below and you will be able to continue your registration shortly.

## Successful registration

Unless you received **an** error message in the course of your registration, an e-mail confirming your registration should normally have been sent to the e-mail address you provided.

## Possible solutions

If you have **not** received **an** email, please check the following options:

1. Be patient: In rare cases, the sending of the confirmation email may be **delayed for** a while.
2. Check your **Spam folder**, the **Advertising** tab if necessary, and the **Trash**. Maybe the email ended up there.
3. If **neither** of these steps has been successful, you can register again [here](https://seatable.io/en/registrierung/) with your e-mail address and you will then receive a **new** confirmation e-mail.
