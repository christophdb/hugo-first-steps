Unfortunately, it is **not possible** in the system to merge individual SeaTable accounts or to transfer people from one team to another team. Therefore, you **cannot** add a **team member** who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**.

## Merging possible via a detour

Of course, you can delete an account (team or team member) at any time and then create a new one in another team. The following procedure is recommended for this:

1. [Export all bases](https://seatable.io/en/docs/historie-und-versionen/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei/) that you want to transfer to the new team.
2. [Delete the team member](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-teammitglied-sperren-oder-loeschen/) or [the entire team](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/das-komplette-team-loeschen/) via the team administration.
3. Create a [new team member](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-neues-teammitglied-hinzufuegen/) in the other team.
4. [Import](https://seatable.io/en/docs/import-von-daten/erstellen-einer-base-aus-einer-dtable-datei/) your previously exported bases.

## Deactivate is not enough

Deactivating the team member in the original team is not sufficient. For SeaTable to use the email address again, you must delete the team member completely.
