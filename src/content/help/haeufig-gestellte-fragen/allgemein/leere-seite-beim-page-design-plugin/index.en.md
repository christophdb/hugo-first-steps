{{< required-version "Fixed with version 3.4." >}}

When creating a new PDF document using the [Page Design plugin]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-seitendesign-plugin" >}}), in some cases an additional blank page is created at the end of the PDF document. This behavior was already confirmed in the forum in December 2022. Version 3.4, which will be released at the end of February 2023, will fix this bug.
