You want to [add a user to your team](https://seatable.io/en/docs/teamverwaltung/ein-neues-teammitglied-hinzufuegen/), but get the error message that this account already exists? This is the solution:

You cannot add a team member who has already created another SeaTable account **with the same e-mail address**. In order to create an account with this email address, this user must back up all their data (e.g. [export](https://seatable.io/en/docs/import-von-daten/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei/) as a [DTABLE file](https://seatable.io/en/docs/import-von-daten/speichern-einer-base-als-dtable-datei/)) and delete their previous account. You can find out more about this in the article [Can two SeaTable accounts be merged?](https://seatable.io/en/docs/haeufig-gestellte-fragen/kann-man-zwei-seatable-konten-zusammenfuehren/)
