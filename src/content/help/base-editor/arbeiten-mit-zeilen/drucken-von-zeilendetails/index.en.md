You have the option to print **row details** similar to [table views](https://seatable.io/en/docs/grundlagen-von-ansichten/das-drucken-einer-ansicht/). Unlike the table view, the row details list the columns below each other (instead of next to each other) and thus provide a clearer breakdown of the entered data for a row.

## How to print rows

## Compact and normal pressure

The **Normal** and **Compact** print types differ in both file size and **appearance**.

- The **Normal pressure** looks very similar to the usual display of row details: you see the entries as you would expect.

- The **Compact pressure** reduces the white space and packs all information into a table structure.
