If you have gradually filled your tables with a large number of new columns, at a certain point it will no longer be possible to have all table columns in view without having to scroll to the right. SeaTable therefore allows you to **fix one or more columns**, which will then remain in their position regardless of scrolling.

By fixing the first column(s) you can **read their data even after scrolling**. This feature is very useful when you want to view or compare values from one of the front columns together with those from the back columns.

The fixed columns always apply to the entire table including all views.

## Adjust the number of fixed columns

1. Move the mouse over the **separator line** between the first two columns until a hand icon appears instead of the mouse pointer with the instruction **Adjust number of fixed columns by dragging**.
1. **Drag** the **cursor** to the end of the last **column** you want to fix.

## Fix the first column

In addition to the way described above, there is **another way** to fix columns. However, this option is available only for the **first column** of each table. Consequently, if you select this option, **only** the first table column will be fixed.

1. Click on the triangular **drop-down symbol** on the right in the table header of the first column.
1. Click **Lock Column**.
