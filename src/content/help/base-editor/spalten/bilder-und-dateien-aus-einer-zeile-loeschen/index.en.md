SeaTable allows you to **delete** **files** and **images** in several ways. The following instructions apply to both [image]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/die-bild-spalte" >}}) and [file columns](https://seatable.io/en/docs/dateien-und-bilder/die-datei-spalte/).

## Remove files and images via the row details

1. Open the detailed view of a row, by clicking on the **double arrow icon**, which appears as soon as you move the mouse over the numbering of the row .
2. In the **Line Details** window, hover over the **image** or **file** you want to delete.
3. In the upper right corner of the miniature, a {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-x" >}} will now appear. Click on this.
4. A dialog opens with the question **Do you really want to delete this file/image?** If yes, click **Delete**.

## Delete via the cell

1. Open the **All Images** or **All Files** window by **double-clicking** the **cell** in an image or file column.
2. For images, deleting works the same as using the line details. For files you have the following options:
    - Click **Select** and select all the files you want to delete. Confirm with **Delete**.
    - Hover the mouse cursor over a file and click the **three-dot icon** to select the **Delete** option.
