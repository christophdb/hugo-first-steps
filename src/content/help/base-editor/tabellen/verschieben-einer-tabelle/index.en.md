At the latest when your base has gradually filled up with various tables, it is time to think about a **sensible order for the tables** in your base. **Move** thematically related tables next to each other and place the most important tables at the top. You will see: Thanks to **drag-and-drop**, moving tables is child's play.

## To move a table in the base header

You can arrange your tables horizontally in the base header as you wish.

2. Hold down the left mouse button and **drag and drop** the desired table to any position in the base header.

## To move a table using the drop-down menu

In bases with a large number of tables, it is more convenient to move the tables vertically using the drop-down list.
