With the help of a **link column**, you can not only [link several tables with each other]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}) in SeaTable, but also **relate data records in one and the same table to each other**.

This is particularly useful if the data in your table has a **hierarchy**.

## Add a link within a table

1. Click on the **plus symbol** to the right of the last column header.
2. Enter the **name for the parent column** in the input field.
3. Select **Link to other entries** as the column type.
4. Select **the current table** as the table to be linked.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.
6. SeaTable automatically adds a **second column for the subordinate entries**.

The two link columns are **inextricably** linked. If you **delete** one of the two columns, the other also disappears immediately. However, if you only want to see one of the two columns in your table, you can [hide]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/ausblenden-und-verschieben-von-spalten" >}}) the other one.

## Linking data records in a table

1. Click in a **cell in the link column** and then on the **plus symbol** that appears.
2. The available **rows in the table** are now listed. Click on the row(s) that you would like to link to the selected row .
3. **The linked entry** is immediately displayed in both link columns.

## Why are there two columns for the same link?

If you create a link column that links entries in one and the same table, SeaTable automatically creates a second link column.

- In the **first** link column, you can see the data records that are**superordinate to** a row .
- In the **second** link column, you can see the data records that are**subordinate to** a row .

The **parents and children** of a parent-child relationship are therefore recorded and displayed in separate columns. In this way, SeaTable ensures that there is a parent and a child data record for each relationship.
