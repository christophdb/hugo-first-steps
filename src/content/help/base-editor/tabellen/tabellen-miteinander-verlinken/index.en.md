At first glance, SeaTable looks like a spreadsheet, but in many places it works like a database. The tables in SeaTable are not isolated, but can relate rows to each other using a [link column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}).

More precisely, link columns create a link between entries. This works both with entries within a table and across multiple tables. In the end, SeaTable does not link entire tables with each other, but rows across table boundaries.

Since you implement this in SeaTable with columns, you will find all further explanations about links and link formulas in the [Columns]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten" >}}) section.

To get started, we recommend the following article: [How to link tables in SeaTable]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}).
