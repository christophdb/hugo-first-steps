Bases consist of one or more tables, which in turn can hold very different data and link to each other. A base can contain **up to 200 tables**. For the sake of clarity, however, you should consider splitting the tables into several bases and synchronizing the data with the [Shared Data Sets](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/funktionsweise-von-gemeinsamen-datensaetzen/) function if you have more than 20 tables.

## Add a table in a base

1. In the **opened base** you will see in the upper left corner the tabs with all the **Tables** of the base.

2. Click the **\[+\] symbol** to the right of the last table tab.
3. Now select **Add table**.
4. Give the new table a **name** and confirm with **Send**.

## Import table from a file

Alternatively, you can also import tables from **files** into your Base. The import takes place as a [CSV file]({{< relref "help/startseite/import-von-daten/datenimport-und-export" >}}#tabelle_importieren).

## Import table from another base

In SeaTable, [Bases](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-bases/bases/) are basically separate entities, but it is not uncommon to need data in another Base as well. Instead of having to export a table from one base and import it into the desired base, SeaTable offers the convenient option of **importing** tables **directly** from other bases and thus transferring data across base boundaries.

[Shared records](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/funktionsweise-von-gemeinsamen-datensaetzen/) also allow you to share a master table in a group and use and synchronize the table offshoots in different bases. You can learn more about this [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/mit-einem-gemeinsamen-datensatz-eine-neue-tabelle-anlegen/).

## Keep the overview

Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. SeaTable also allows you to use emojis in the table name, making the table tabs shorter.

You can find detailed instructions in the article [Using emojis in table names](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-in-tabellen/verwendung-von-emojis-im-tabellennamen/).
