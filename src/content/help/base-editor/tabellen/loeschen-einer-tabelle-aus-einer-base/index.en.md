You no longer need individual tables from your bases? Then you can delete them with just a few mouse clicks. It's that simple:

![Delete a table from a base](images/delete-a-table.png)

1. In your Base you will find all **tables** of **the Base** displayed as **tabs** in the upper left corner.
2. Click the **triangle icon** at the end of **the name of the table** you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete table**.
4. Confirm the deletion by pressing **Delete** again.
