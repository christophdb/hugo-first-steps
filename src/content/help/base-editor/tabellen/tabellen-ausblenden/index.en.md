The base header can become confusing, especially for bases with a large number of tables. SeaTable therefore offers the option of **hiding** less frequently used **tables**. A hidden table is no longer displayed as a tab in the base header and can only be accessed via the **drop-down menu**.

![Hide tables](images/Tabellen-ausblenden.gif)

- Click on the **drop-down arrow** to the right of the last visible table.
- Move the mouse over the **list of tables** and click on the **eye symbol** to the right of each table that you want to hide.
- The **tabs** of the corresponding tables disappear and a **note** appears permanently in the base header indicating how many tables are hidden.

You can **work** in a hidden table in the same way as in a visible table **without any restrictions**. If you want to **show** a table in the base header again, proceed in exactly the same way as described in the instructions above.

By the way, you can also [move]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/verschieben-einer-tabelle" >}}) tables [using drag-and-drop]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/verschieben-einer-tabelle" >}}) so that your most frequently used tables are always ready to hand on the left in the base header.
