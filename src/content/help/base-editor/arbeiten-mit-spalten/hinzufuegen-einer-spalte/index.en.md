Tables in SeaTable consist of columns and rows. Within a base you can add up to 500 columns to a table. For each column you have individually the possibility to select a suitable **column type** depending on the data type.

A detailed overview of all column types currently available in SeaTable can be found [here](https://seatable.io/en/docs/spalten/uebersicht-alle-spaltentypen/).
