You can save a base in SeaTable as a **snapshot** at any time. Snapshots are part of SeaTable's DNA: Ever since the first version, you have been able to create **snapshots** of the status of a base and restore them at a later point in time. Snapshots are useful, for example, if you want to save the current version of a base before making extensive changes.

Good to know: SeaTable automatically creates one snapshot per day of each Base where changes have been made. This way you always have backup copies of your Bases with the latest versions.

{{< warning  headline="Attention"  text="Although snapshots are copies of a base's save states, they **do not contain all** information and settings. For example, you cannot restore **comments**, **automations** and **apps** with snapshots. You can find out more about this at the end of the article." />}}

## Manual creation of a snapshot

![Manual creation of a snapshot](images/manual-creation-of-a-snapshot.gif)

1. Click on {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-history" >}} **versions** at the top right of the base options.
2. Select the **Snapshots** option in the drop-down menu that opens.
3. Click **Create Snapshot**.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="You can create a snapshot **every 10 minutes**. If you try to do this before then, a message appears stating that the snapshot could not be created." />}}

## Storage duration of snapshots

The snapshots of bases are kept for a certain period of time and then deleted.

With [SeaTable Cloud](https:/cloud.seatable.io), the storage duration of the snapshots depends on [your team's subscription]({{< relref "pages/prices" >}}):

- With the free **subscription**, the snapshots are saved for one month.
- With the **Plus** or **Enterprise subscription**, snapshots are stored for 6 or 12 months. (The extended storage period applies from the time of the upgrade).

If you operate your own [SeaTable server]({{< relref "pages/product/seatable-server" >}}), you can set the snapshot storage duration individually.
