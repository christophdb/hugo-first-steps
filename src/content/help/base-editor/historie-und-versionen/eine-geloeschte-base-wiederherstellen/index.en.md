Bases that you have created under "My Bases" or in groups can be deleted and restored from the respective recycle bin if required. Note that you can restore a Base only up to 30 days after deleting it. After this time, deleted Bases are permanently removed from SeaTable and can no longer be restored.

## Restore a Base deleted from "My Bases

5. You can now find the restored base on the home page under **My Bases**.

## Restore deleted base of a group

You **cannot** restore bases that have been deleted from a group in the way described above, because each group has its own **recycle bin**. Using the recycle bin of a group, you can restore all bases of the group that have been deleted in the last 30 days.
