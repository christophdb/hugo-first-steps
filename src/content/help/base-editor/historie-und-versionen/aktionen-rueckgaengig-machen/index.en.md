You can undo actions in SeaTable in two different ways. SeaTable supports both the well-known key combination {{< key "CTRL" >}}+{{< key "Z" >}} as well as a corresponding option by mouse click. Here you will learn how to undo your last work steps and entries:

## Undo actions via key combination

If you are currently in the **Editing** a **Base** or **Table** and you want to undo one or more entries, just press the key combination {{< key "CTRL" >}}+{{< key "Z" >}} to press. Each time you type this key combination, SeaTable will display your last **Change** **undo** make

## Undo actions by mouse click

Alternatively, you can undo your last action with **a mouse click** in SeaTable's **web interface**.

1. In the top right corner of base Options, click **Versions** and in the drop-down menu that opens, click **Undo**.
2. With each click you undo your last **change**.
