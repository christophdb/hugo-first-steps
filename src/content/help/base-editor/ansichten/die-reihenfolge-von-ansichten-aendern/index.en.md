You can change the **order** in which your views of a table are listed as you wish. Moving is done conveniently via **drag-and-drop**.

## Change the order of the views

1. Click the **name of the current view**.
2. Move the mouse to the view you want to move.
3. Hold the appearing **Six dots icon**

    ![Icon for moving elements](images/move-icon.png)
    to move and drag the view to the desired position. A **black line** shows you the position to which the row will jump.

4. Release the mouse button as soon as the view is at the desired position.
