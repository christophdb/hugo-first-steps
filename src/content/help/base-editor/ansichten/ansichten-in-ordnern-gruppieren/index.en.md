In addition to changing the order, you can also arrange your views more clearly using **folders**. To do this, create as many view folders as you like and move your views using drag-and-drop.

## Grouping views in folders

### Create a new folder

1. Click on the **name of the current view**.
2. Go to **Add view or folder**.
3. Select the lowest option called **Folder**.
4. Give the folder a **name** and confirm with **Submit**.

After you have created **the first new view folder**, all the views you have already created will automatically be in the **More views** folder. Move the views to fill the folders you have created.

### Move views to a folder

1. Click on the **name of the current view**.
2. Move the mouse pointer to the view that you want to move to the created folder.
3. Hold down the left mouse button on the **six-dot grab area** and drag the view to the desired folder.

## Managing your own view folders

Once you have created your own folder, you can also **rename** it, **delete** it or **add new views directly in the folder**. To do this, move the mouse pointer over the folder and click on the **three dots**.

However, you cannot edit the system folder **More views**.
