In addition to changing the order, you can also arrange your views more clearly using **folders**. To do this, create as many view folders as you like and sort your views.

## Grouping views in folders

1. Click the **name of the current view**.
2. Select the lowest option labeled **View or Add Folder**.
3. Select the **Add folder** option.
4. Name the folder and confirm with **Submit**.
5. Move the mouse to the view you want to move to the created folder.
6. Hold the **Six dots icon**

    to move and drag the view to the desired folder.

## Automatic new folder

After you create **the first new views folder**, all the views you have already created will automatically be in the **More** Views folder. Move the views to fill your specially created folders.
