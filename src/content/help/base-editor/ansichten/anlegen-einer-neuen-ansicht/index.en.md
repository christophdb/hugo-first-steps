In SeaTable, you can create different views for your tables and thus view the same data in different ways. For example, if you want to filter for a specific value in a table, you can save the filtered view of the table and thus access it more quickly in the future without having to filter again.

## How to create a new view in SeaTable

![Create a new view](images/create-table-view.jpg)

1. Click on the **name of the current view**.
2. Click on **Add view or folder** and select the desired **view type**.

3. Give the new view a **name**.
4. Activate the slider if the new view should not be visible to everyone but **private**.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.

The newly created **view** then opens automatically and you can **filter**, **sort** or **group** it according to any values, for example.

Detailed information about the three tools **grouping**, **sorting** and **filtering** can be found [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/gruppierung-sortierung-und-filter" >}}).

Additionally, you have the option to create private views. In which points private views differ from normal views, you will learn [in this article]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/unterschiede-zwischen-privaten-und-normalen-ansichten" >}}).
