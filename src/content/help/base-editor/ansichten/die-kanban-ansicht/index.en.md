A **Kanban view** is predestined to visualize dynamic processes with different phases. In this respect, it allows you to visualize **workflows** and **project progress**, for example. It is particularly helpful for [project planning]({{< relref "templates/projects/project-plan" >}}), [software development]({{< relref "templates/software-development/bug-tracker" >}}) or task distribution within a team.

{{< warning type="warning" headline="Requirements" >}}

In order to be able to use the Kanban view sensibly, you need at least one column in your table that allows options to be clearly assigned. The column types [Single select]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-einfachauswahl-spalte" >}}) or [Collaborator]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-mitarbeiter-spalte" >}}) are suitable for this.

## Structure of a Kanban view

A Kanban view consists of **pillars** that stand for different steps or phases in a process. In a workflow, for example, these can be "idea", "planned", "in progress" and "done".

You provide the columns with **movable cards** that you can move both within a column and from one column to the next. A Kanban card can represent a work package or a task, for example.

5. Confirm with **Submit**.

6. Specify which column you want to use for the **grouping**, i.e. the definition of the columns. The Kanban view is then generated automatically.
7. In the **Title field**, enter the column with which you want to label the Kanban cards.
8. Optionally, you can also activate **sliders** to activate certain functions or display more columns.

If you want to change something later, click on the **gearwheel icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}} in the top right-hand corner and adjust the **settings**.

## Settings of the Kanban view

You can use the slider options to change the visual display of the Kanban view.

- You can use the **Don't show empty values** slider to remove grayed-out placeholders on the Kanban cards.
- The **Show field names** slider shows the column names above all activated information.
- The **Wrap text** slider formats texts so that they are fully legible on the Kanban board cards.

## Show and hide other columns

All **columns** that you have created in your table are listed in the lower section. By activating the individual **controllers**, the entries in the respective columns become visible as informative notes on the cards.

{{< warning headline="Note" text="Open the **row details** by clicking on a card to see all the information in a row, even if the sliders are not activated." />}}

## View options

You can use the following options in a Kanban view:

- [Filter]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/filtern-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht" >}}) or [sort]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/sortieren-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht" >}}) by any value
