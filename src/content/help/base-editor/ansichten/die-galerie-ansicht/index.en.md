The **Gallery view** uses preview images from an [image column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-bild-spalte" >}}) to arrange data records clearly in tiles. Several images are combined in an **album**. This display is suitable for a variety of use cases, for example [employee profiles]({{< relref "templates/human-resources/employee-directory" >}}), [product libraries]({{< relref "templates/product-design/product-library" >}}), [inventory lists]({{< relref "templates/operations/inventory-list" >}}) or [the management of collections]({{< relref "templates/operations/art-gallery-management" >}}).

## View options

You can use the following options in a Gallery view:
- [Lock view]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/ansicht-sperren" >}})
- [Filter]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/filtern-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht" >}}) or [sort]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/sortieren-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht" >}}) by any value
- [Share view with others]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/freigabe-einer-ansicht-an-ein-teammitglied" >}})

## Show and hide information

In the **Gallery settings**, which you can access via the **gearwheel icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}}, you can display more or less information by showing or hiding columns. Activate the **sliders** of the respective columns to display more information from the data records in the gallery.

## Multiple images in one album

The **number of images** per album is displayed in the gallery with a **grey highlighted number**. Logically, the number is only displayed if there is more than one image in an album.

Click on the preview image to open the album in **full screen mode**, in which you can enlarge and reduce the images using the **magnifying glasses** and switch between the images using the **arrows**.
