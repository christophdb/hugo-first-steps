The calendar view shows you data from a table in **calendar form**. You can get an overview of **different time periods (year, month, week, day)** or display appointments as **agenda** in list form.

One example is the monthly overview in a vacation calendar:

{{< warning type="warning" headline="Requirements" >}}

To be able to use the calendar view sensibly, you need at least one [date column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-datum-spalte" >}}) in your table.

{{< /warning >}}

![create a calendar view](images/calendar-view-settings.jpg)

6. In the **Title field**, enter the column with which you want to label the calendar entries.
7. Specify which date column should be used for the **Start date**. The calendar view is then generated automatically.
8. Optionally, you can specify a date or duration column for the **End date**, which defines the period of the calendar entries.
9. Finally, select which day of the week should be used as the **first day of the week**.

If you want to change something later, click on the **gearwheel icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}} in the top right-hand corner and adjust the **settings**.

## The display options in detail

### Monthly overview

This view gives you an overview of all the days in a **month**. You can also call up the **row details** here by clicking on one of the calendar entries.

### Weekly overview

This display shows you the **times** on the vertical axis and the seven days of a **week** from left to right. You can also open the **row details** here by clicking on one of the dates.

### Daily planner

The daily planner is particularly suitable if you want to have several appointments on one **day** on the screen. Just like the weekly overview, it shows you the **times** on the vertical axis. You can also open the **row details** here by clicking on one of the appointments.

### Agenda display

The **Agenda** lists all appointments within a **month** and offers you the option of viewing certain **information** on the appointments at a glance.

To do this, simply show the desired **columns** of the table in the **settings** of the calendar view – for example, topic, status and type of publication.
