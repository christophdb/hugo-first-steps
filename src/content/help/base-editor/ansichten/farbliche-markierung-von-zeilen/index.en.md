With the help of the **rows-format tool** you can set colored markings at the beginning of rows. The **color marking of rows** serves the quick identification of certain data sets. This is not to be confused with [coloring cells]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/einfaerben-von-zellen" >}}), which allows you to highlight individual cells.

## The rows-format tool

In the view options above a table you will find the following icon:

After clicking on the rows-format tool, you can choose between **three options** for color highlighting:

- Use single selection column
- Use rules
- Highlight duplicates

## Use single select column

For the **Use single selection column** option, you need a column of this type in your table. This allows you to mark each row at the beginning with the color of the respective option that is entered in this column.

## Use rules

The **Use rules** option allows you to set conditions for color highlighting.

- Click on the **colored triangle symbol**to change the color of the marker.

- Specify to which of your **Columns** the condition should refer to.

- Decide for the **Condition type**.

### Use rule example

In this example, all rows in an editorial plan that are marked as completed in the [checkbox column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-checkbox-spalte" >}}) are to be marked. To do this, the **"Published" column** was selected, the condition **"is"** was used and it was specified that the rows **with a checkmark** should be marked.

### Example of a rule with multiple conditions

In this example, we only want to highlight rows the editorial plan in color if the **status** of the post is not "finished", the **publication date** is in the future and an **image** already exists.

## Highlight duplicates

rows with one or more identical column values can be highlighted using the **Highlight Duplicates** option. To do this, select the column you want to check for duplicates. This way you can easily identify duplicates in your table and correct or delete them if necessary.
