In each table, you have the option of permanently displaying all available [views]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/was-ist-eine-ansicht" >}}) in a navigation bar on the left-hand side. This is particularly useful if you often switch between views and **quick access** makes this more efficient.

Pinned **view navigation** remains visible even if you scroll to the right within a table. This allows you to easily compare entries in different views.

## To show and hide the view navigation

1. Click on the drop-down icon {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-drop-down" color="grey" >}} next to the currently open view.
2. Click on the pin {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-pin" color="grey" >}}.

As long as the pin is highlighted in **red**, the available table views are **pinned** to the left-hand side of the page. To **hide** the view navigation again, click on the pin again.
