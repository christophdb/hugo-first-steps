By default, SeaTable displays all rows with a compact row height to show as many records as possible. However, with this **default row height**, among other things, [text]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-spalten-text-und-formatierter-text" >}}), [link]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}})and [multiple select columns]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-mehrfachauswahl-spalte" >}}) are truncated and only small **thumbnails** of images are displayed.

This row height may be suitable for most of your use cases, but there may be situations when you want to see more content of the respective rows. That's why SeaTable allows you to adjust the row height in each of your views.

Specifically, four different row heights are available for this purpose:

- Default
- Double
- Triple
- Quadruple

## Adjust row height

1. Click the **row height** icon in the view options.
2. **Set** the desired row height.

{{< warning  headline="One row height for all rows"  text="The row height is always adjusted for **all** rows of a view. Individual row heights within a view are not possible." />}}
