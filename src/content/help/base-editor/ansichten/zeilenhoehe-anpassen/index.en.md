By default, SeaTable displays all rows with a compact row height to show as many records as possible. However, with this **simple row height**, among other things, [text]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}) and [multiple selection columns](https://seatable.io/en/docs/auswahlspalten/die-mehrfachauswahl-spalte/) are truncated and only small **thumbnails** of images are displayed.

This row height may be suitable for most of your use cases, but there may be situations when you want to see more content of the respective rows . That's why SeaTable allows you to adjust the row height in each of your views.

Specifically, four different line heights are available for this purpose:

- Simple (the default value for new tables and views)
- Double
- Triple
- Quadruple

## Adjust row height

2. **Select** the desired line height.
   {{< warning  headline="One line height for all rows"  text="The row height is always adjusted for **all** rows of a view. Individual row heights within a view are not possible." />}}
