To create an exact copy of a view and apply all its settings, you can **duplicate** the view. You can then adjust the settings of the duplicated view as needed and [rename]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/umbenennen-einer-ansicht" >}}) the view.

## Duplicate views

1. Click the **name of the current view**.
2. Hover the mouse over the view you want to duplicate.
3. **Three points** become visible in the view line. Select them.
4. Select the **Duplicate View** option.
5. A **copy** of the selected view will be created.

## Duplicate an existing normal view into a private view

Private views, as the name suggests, are **not** visible to other users. Therefore, they are particularly suitable for your personal data view when you collaborate with other users in a table where the view settings such as **filters, groupings and hidden columns** change frequently.

To **avoid** having to reconfigure your private view in this case, SeaTable offers the option to duplicate an existing view into a **private view** that can **only** be edited by you.
