The more columns you create to enter data, the more confusing your table becomes. To ensure that you always have an overview of your data, you can hide individual table columns that are not currently needed or are irrelevant. In addition, you can adjust the order of the columns as you wish using drag-and-drop.

## Hide columns

![Hide columns](images/hide-coloumns-2.gif)

1. Click **Hide** in the view options of any table.
2. Hide any number of columns **by clicking on** them. Using the **search field**, you can narrow the selection of columns or search for a specific column you want to hide.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="You can decide **individually for each column** whether it should be shown or hidden, or with a click on **Hide All** you can hide all columns except the first column of the table at the same time. Just as effortlessly, you can show all columns again with a click on **Show All**." />}}

## Move columns

Hold the mouse button on the **Six dots symbols** ![Icon for moving elements](images/move-icon.png) in front of the column names and drag them up or down in the list to change the order of the columns in the table as you wish.

In addition, you can also move the columns directly in the **table view** using drag-and-drop. To do this, hold down the mouse button on the **name of a column** and move the column to the right or left.

Please note that the **first column of** a table **cannot** be moved. You can read about other special features of the first column in the corresponding [overview article]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/die-besonderheiten-der-ersten-spalte" >}}).
