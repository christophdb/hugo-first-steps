SeaTable formulas offer you several ways to work with the data in your tables. One possibility is to **search for words in a text**. By entering an appropriate formula you can automatically search a [text column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-spalten-text-und-formatierter-text" >}}) for any words and have a hint - e.g. "word found/not found" - written as a result in a formula column of your table.

## Search for a word in a text

In the concrete example, the goal is to search for a **word** in the text column **"Request"** using a formula.

To do this, first add a **formula column** to the table, in whose editor you can then insert the **formula**.

To search for a word in a text column, first add an **If** operator to the formula, which you can find in the formula editor under the **Logical Functions** tab. It examines whether a defined **condition** is true or not and returns a certain **value** depending on the positive or negative result.

In the next step you extend the formula with the function **find**, with the help of which the text column can be searched for a specific word. You can find the function in the formula editor at the **text functions**.

The two functions are followed in the formula by the **specific word** you want to search for in the text column. Write the word **in quotation marks** in the formula.

The next part of the formula is the **name of the column** that should be checked for the presence of the searched word. It is especially important that the column name is enclosed in **curly braces**, otherwise SeaTable will **not** be able to recognize which text should be checked using the formula.

Insert the mathematical equation `1 > 0` after the column name. This is important for the formula, as it indicates that a specific **value** is returned as soon as the searched word is found **at least once** in the text column. In the formula, make sure to **close** the bracket **after** the first number. The **comparison characters** ( > , < , = , etc.) can be found in the formula editor under **operators**.

Finally, you define in the formula the **values** that are returned to you in the formula column for **finding** or **not finding** the searched word in the text. The **first** value entered always appears in the formula column if the searched word was **found** in the text, the second value in the opposite case. Always place the values **in quotation marks** and separate them with a **comma**.

Before confirming, it is still important to note that you must **close the parenthesis** so that the formula is accepted as valid.

After confirming the entered formula, you can see from the value in the **formula column** whether the searched word was found in the text column.
