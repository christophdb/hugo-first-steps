The Countlinks formula counts the number of linked entries of the column type **Link to other entries** in the respective row.

{{< warning  headline="Table linking is a basic requirement" >}}

You can create a column with the Countlinks formula only if you have linked two tables. Read [here how to create such a link]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}).

## Scope of the Countlinks Formula

The **Countlinks formula** should be used whenever you want to display the **number of entries of** another table as a cross-reference.

For example, you can use this to map the number of registered participants from a separate table when planning a workshop. The [link column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}) would thus hold the names of all participants.

Using the Countlinks formula makes sense only if you enable the **Allow link to multiple rows** option when creating a column of the **Link to other entries** type. If the option were turned off, there would always be a one in the Countlinks formula field.

## Create a Countlinks formula
