    title: 'Findmin formula in SeaTable – find the smallest value'
    description: 'Use the Findmin formula to get the minimum numeric value from linked records in SeaTable. Perfect for cross‑table data analysis.'
---

The **Findmin formula** searches among the entries of a linked column for the **minimum value** and returns it. This is useful if there are **several entries** in the linked table that refer to the same record (e.g. of a person) in another table.

The Findmin formula works exclusively with **numerical values**, which is why the content of the linked column must also consist of numerical values. In addition, the use of the Findmin formula only makes sense if the **Allow link to multiple rows** slider is enabled when creating the **Link to other entries** column. If the option were off, the Findmin formula would always contain the same number as in the linked column.

## What you need the Findmin formula for

The **Findmin function** should be used when you want to **cross-reference** numerical values stored in different tables. Let's say you use SeaTable to collect the **working hours of** your employees, where one table stores the employees and another table stores the daily activity. You can then link each employee record to the working hours entered.

To determine when an employee logged in for the first time, you can use the **Findmin formula** to display the **smallest value** - in this case the first login - from the total login times in a column.

You can use the Findmin formula with all numeric values to represent the **minimum value**.

## How to use the Findmin formula

### Add a table link

Find out how to create a column of the type **Link to other entries** [in]({{< relref "help/base-editor/tabellen/wie-man-tabellen-in-seatable-miteinander-verknuepft" >}}). This is a basic requirement to be able to use the Findmin formula.

### Add a column with Findmin formula

![findmin formula](images/findmin.gif)

1. Create a new column of the type **Formula for links**.
2. Set the **Findmin** option as the formula.
3. Select the previously created column of the type **Link to other entries** in this table.
4. Now, in the **Select lookup column** field **in the linked table "..."**, specify the column from the other table that you want to link to the column here.
5. Click **Submit**.
