SeaTable formulas offer you several ways to work with the data in your tables. One of them is merging content from different [text columns](https://seatable.io/en/docs/text-und-zahlen/die-spalten-text-und-formatierter-text/). Using an appropriate formula, you can merge any number of contents from different columns into one formula column.

## Merging text columns

In the concrete example, the goal is to use a formula to merge the contents (last name, first name, and title) of the first three columns into a **complete name**.

![Example table for merging different contents into one formula column](https://seatable.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/example-table-zusammenfuehren-von-inhalten-mit-Formel.png)

To do this, you first add a **formula column** to the table, in whose editor you can then insert the formula.

To merge content from different text columns into one column, you must always refer to the **names of the columns** where the corresponding content can be found in your table. It is especially important that the column names are framed with **curly brackets**, otherwise SeaTable **cannot** recognize which contents are to be merged.

To merge the contents of the text columns into a formula column, first arrange the column names in the desired **order** in the formula and separate each of them with an **& symbol**, which you will find in the formula editor near the **operands**.

To separate the different contents by a **space**, add an **& symbol** and **two quotation marks (above)** **after the** first two column names.

After confirming the entered formula, the contents of the text columns are automatically merged and the **result** appears automatically in the formula column.

{{< warning  headline="Professional tip" >}}

Whenever you use text columns in a formula and these columns can also be empty, it is recommended to use the _trim( )_ function. This function removes blanks at the beginning and end of a text. The complete formula is then e.g.

```
trim( {Title} & " " & {Surname} & " " & {Name} )
```
