SeaTable formulas offer you several ways to work with the data in your tables. One possibility is the conditional filling of values using **If** operators.  
By entering a corresponding formula, you can have the values in the formula column - depending on the data in other table columns - filled automatically.

## Logical if operators

In the concrete example, the goal is to use a formula to automatically capture the **salutation** of different customers, depending on their **gender**, in a formula column.

![Example table for the use of if operators in formulas](images/Beispiel-Tabelle-fuer-die-Verwendung-von-If-Operatoren-in-Formeln.png)

To do this, first add a **formula column** to the table, in whose editor you can then insert the **formula**.

To automatically collect the gender-specific salutation of the customers in the formula column, first add an **If** operator to the formula. You can find this in the formula editor under the **Logical functions** tab. If operators **check** whether the entry in a selected column meets the conditions defined in advance and return a corresponding **value** depending on the positive or negative result.

In the next step, you define the **conditions** that must apply in the desired column so that the formula column is automatically filled with the appropriate values.

To do this, you must first refer to the concrete **column** in which the condition must apply. The column name must be framed with **curly brackets**.

![Reference to the column in which the defined conditions must occur](images/Verweis-auf-die-Spalte-in-der-die-definierten-Bedingungen-eintreten-muessen.png)

Directly after the "Gender" column, first set a desired **operator**. If the column must contain an exact value, use the operator **\=** (is equal to), for example. You can also find the operators on the left in the formula editor.

After the operator, define the concrete **conditions** that must apply in the column so that the formula column is automatically filled with the corresponding salutation. First write the **value** that must be present in the "Gender" column **in quotation marks** in the formula. Separated by a **comma**, the **salutation** follows, also in quotation marks, which is inserted into the formula column.

To populate the salutation with the respective **names**, reference the "First Name" and/or "Last Name" columns with curly braces. Learn more about [merging text columns using a formula]({{< relref "help/base-editor/formeln/formelbeispiel-zusammenfuehren-von-text-spalten-mit-hilfe-einer-formel" >}}).

You can then repeat the steps described for defining a condition for **each value** in the "Gender" column. The different conditions must always be separated by a **comma**. Before confirming, it is important that you **close all brackets** so that the formula is accepted as valid.

After confirming the entered formula, the **values** defined for each condition are automatically written to the **formula column of** your table.
