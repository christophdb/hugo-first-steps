Automations are a useful feature of SeaTable that helps you **automate work processes**. Consequently, with the help of automations you can not only **save time**, but also **minimize** the number of **human errors** in maintaining your data, since automatically completed process steps no longer need to be performed manually by a user.

Accordingly, automations have a particularly large impact in **large data sets** where they can handle a high number of work processes.

The following article is intended to give you an overview of the topic of automations in SeaTable and includes links to the various help articles related to this feature.

## The SeaTable automation editor

You can access the automation editor of a base via the corresponding icon in the base header.

The automation editor extends across the entire width of the window and therefore enables a clear layout: The **list of all existing automation rules** is located on the left-hand side. Switching between two rules is therefore just a matter of one click. You can also add new rules and manage existing ones here.

In the central area, you can see the configuration of the currently selected automation. This consists of a **trigger** and one or more **actions**. The settings of the trigger or actions are displayed dynamically on the right-hand side – depending on which element you have just clicked on.

You can also collapse the list of automation rules to create more space in the central area. Another convenience factor is the **variable height of the editor panel**. This allows you to see the view, column names and data records while you are working on an automation.

## Create an automation

The first step towards automated work processes is the creation of an automation. To ensure that everything goes according to plan and that the automation rules created have the desired effect, we have summarized the most important information for you in this article.

Learn how to create an automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/anlegen-einer-automation" >}}).

## Manage automations

Of course, you can manage already created, active automations afterwards. In this article, we will introduce you to the settings you can make when automating your work processes.

Learn more about managing automations [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automationen-verwalten-und-gruppieren" >}}).

## How automation works

This article basically explains how automations work in SeaTable and is therefore suitable for **getting started with the topic of automations**.

Learn more about how automations work [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/funktionsweise-von-automationen" >}}).

## Automation triggers

Automation triggers represent the first of the two essential components of automations. The triggers, which you can set individually for each automation, trigger different types of automated actions.

Learn more about automation triggers [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automations-trigger" >}}).

## Automation actions

Automated actions represent the second of the two essential components of automations. The actions are triggered by the defined trigger events. Depending on the trigger, SeaTable can perform different automation actions.

Learn more about automation actions [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automations-aktionen" >}}).

## Show execution log of an automation

To check the execution of automations, you have the option of displaying the execution log for each automation rule. In this log, you can view information about each automation run.

Learn more about the execution log of an automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/ausfuehrungslog-einer-automation-anzeigen" >}}).

## Stop automations

Active automations that you no longer need for a certain period of time can simply be paused and reactivated as needed.

Learn how to stop automations [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automationen-stoppen" >}}).

## Delete automations

You can also delete automations that are no longer needed. Please note that you cannot restore deleted automations.

Learn how to delete automations [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automationen-loeschen" >}}).

## Lock rows by automation

With the help of automations, you no longer have to manually lock rows in your tables, but can have this lock executed automatically. This is very useful if you always want to prevent a row from being edited further after a certain point in time (e.g. when a process has been completed).

Learn how to lock rows with automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/beispiel-zeilen-per-automation-sperren" >}}).

## Add rows via automation

With the help of automations, you no longer have to manually add rows with certain values to your tables, but can have these steps performed automatically. This is especially advantageous if you want to automate various process steps in your tables.

Learn how to add rows via automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/beispiel-zeilen-per-automation-hinzufuegen" >}}).

## Add records to other tables via automation

With the help of automations, you no longer have to add records in other tables manually, but can have these steps performed automatically. The great advantage of this is that the trigger does not have to be in the same table as the action that is triggered. This automation is especially beneficial when you use different tables whose contents are related to each other.

Learn how to add records to other tables via automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/beispiel-eintraege-in-andere-tabellen-per-automation-hinzufuegen" >}}).

## E-mail dispatch via automation

With the help of automations, you no longer have to send e-mails manually to selected users, but can have them sent automatically. This is especially helpful if, for example, you want to inform users immediately about changes to the data in certain tables.

Learn how to send e-mails via automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/beispiel-e-mail-versand-per-automation" >}}).

## Linking records via automation

With the help of automations, you no longer have to link records in your tables manually, but can have these steps performed automatically. This is useful when you need certain data across multiple tables.

Learn how to link records via automation [here]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/beispiel-verlinken-von-eintraegen-per-automation" >}}).

## Why can't I find the automations in my base?

Can't find the automation function in your bases? It might have something to do with your SeaTable subscription.
