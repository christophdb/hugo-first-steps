You cannot create automations in your bases? A possible cause could be an insufficient [subscription](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/abo-pakete/).

Here you will find the automation function, if it is available in your subscription:

If you want to use this powerful feature of SeaTable in the future, you can upgrade to an Enterprise subscription.

## Upgrade to SeaTable Enterprise

Automations are currently only available for teams with a **[SeaTable Enterprise subscription](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/abo-pakete/)** are currently only available to teams with a SeaTable Enterprise subscription. If you cannot find this feature in your bases, your team probably does **not** have such a subscription. To use automations, you need to [upgrade](https://seatable.io/en/docs/abo-abrechnung/abonnement-verwaltung/#abonnement-anpassen) **your team's subscription to** an Enterprise subscription.

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="A subscription is always valid for the **entire team**. **No** individual bases or team members can be upgraded." />}}
