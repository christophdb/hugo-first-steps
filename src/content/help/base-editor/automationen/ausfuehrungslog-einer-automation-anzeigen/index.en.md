You can view the following information in the execution log of an automation:

**Execution time**  
Here SeaTable stores the exact time when the trigger initiated the automation.

**Execution condition**  
If the automation is triggered by the change or addition of a record, the message **per_update** appears. On the other hand, if the automation is triggered periodically, the message **per_day/week/month** appears.

**Status**  
The status indicates whether the automation was executed successfully. If this is the case, the message **Success** appears here.

**Warnings**  
If there were problems during the execution of an automation, a corresponding warning message appears here.
