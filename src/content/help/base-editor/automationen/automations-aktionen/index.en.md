**Automated actions** represent one of the two essential components of automations. The actions are triggered by defined **trigger events**. Depending on the [trigger]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automations-trigger" >}}), SeaTable can perform different automation actions. This article provides you with an **overview of** the different types of automated actions.

## Available automation actions

The latest version of SeaTable offers a total of 13 different automation actions to choose from:

- Send notification
- Send app notification
- Send e-mail
- Add record
- Lock record
- Modify record
- Add links
- Add record to another table
- Run Python script
- Run AI
- Run data processing
- Convert page to PDF
- Generate PDF from document and send

## Add, duplicate, move and delete automation actions

To add an action, click on **the large button with the plus symbol** and select the corresponding action from the drop-down list. Please note that the available actions differ depending on the trigger.

If you have already set up more complex actions, such as sending e-mails, data processing or AI functions, you can also duplicate these. Simply click on the **three dots** and then on **Duplicate**. This means you only have to make minor adjustments to these actions and saves you a lot of time.

![duplicate automation actions](images/duplicate-automated-actions.jpg)

The order of the actions can be easily changed **by drag-and-drop**. Move the mouse pointer over an action box, hold down the left mouse button on the **six-point drag area** and move the action to the desired position. This allows you to flexibly adapt the automation sequence.

![Move automation actions](images/move-automated-actions.gif)

Of course, you can also delete actions that are no longer required. To do this, click on the **three dots** and then on **Delete**. Please note that the automated actions are removed **immediately and permanently** and cannot be restored.
