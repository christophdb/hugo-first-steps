**Trigger events** are one of the two essential components of automations. The events trigger different types of [actions]({{< relref "help/base-editor/automationen/automations-aktionen" >}}), which you can define individually for each automation. This article provides you with an **overview** of the different types of triggers.

## Available automation triggers

In the latest version of SeaTable, there are a total of **four** different triggers to choose from:

- When a row is updated
- When a row is added
- At scheduled time
- At scheduled time for records that match conditions

## Trigger settings

To create or edit a trigger, click on the corresponding box in the central area of the automation editor. The trigger settings then appear on the right.

- You can first change the **trigger** using the drop-down menu. To do this, select the desired trigger event.
- Then define the **table** and the **view** in which the automation should take effect.
- Depending on the type of trigger, you can make further settings, e.g. **monitored columns**, **conditions** for triggering or the **time** of triggering.

## Automation trigger: When a row is updated

If you select this event as a trigger, the corresponding automation is triggered each time a value is changed in one of the monitored columns and a row in the selected view meets certain conditions after editing. If you want the trigger to fire every time a change is made, do not add any conditions.

For the **Conditions**, you can define individually for each column what the corresponding value must look like after editing in order for the automation to start. As part of this, you can decide whether all or only selected columns in the view should be monitored for the occurrence of the trigger event.

- Add record
- Lock record
- Modify record
- Add links
- Add record to another table

## Automation trigger: When a row is added

If you select this event as a trigger, the corresponding automation will be triggered every time a **new row** is added in the selected view. In addition, you can further restrict the occurrence of the event by defining **conditions** that the new row must fulfill.

In the conditions, you can specify individually for each column what the corresponding value must be for the automation to start. If you want each new row to trigger the automation, do not add any conditions.
