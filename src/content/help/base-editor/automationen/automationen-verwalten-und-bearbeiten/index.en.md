2. Click {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-rule" >}} in the base header and then click **Automation Rules**.
3. Hover the mouse cursor over the corresponding automation rule and click the **pencil icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-rename" >}}.
4. Make the desired **adjustments to** the automation.
5. Confirm with **Submit**.

## Management options

You can adjust the following settings for an automation:

- The **name**
- The **table** in which the automation acts
- The **view in** which the automation acts
- The **trigger event of** an automation
- The **columns** that SeaTable monitors with a view to the occurrence of the trigger event
