    title: 'Adjusting date settings in your SeaTable base easily'
    description: 'Change the first day of the week for each SeaTable base. Set Monday, Saturday or Sunday to match your calendar needs. All changes are saved automatically.'

As is common in Europe and many other regions, SeaTable uses **Monday** as the first day of the week by default. However, depending on which country you live in, Saturday or Sunday may be the **first day of the week**. You can therefore adapt SeaTable to your regional circumstances: In the **Date settings**, the first day of the week can be set individually for each base.

{{< warning type="warning" headline="Important note" >}}
Only **owners** and **administrators** can edit the date settings of a base that belongs to a group. Simple group members will **not** see the date settings.

## Change the first day of the week in a base

![Date settings in a base](images/date-settings-of-a-base.gif)

1. Open the **base** whose date settings you want to edit.
2. Click on the **three dots** in the base header.
3. Go to **Settings** and then to **Date settings**.
4. In the new window, select which day of the week should be the **first day of the week**.
5. Then **close** the window. The settings you have made are automatically **saved**.

## Scope of the date settings

An adjustment in the date settings causes the selected day to move to the first column in the calendar control of [date columns]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-datum-spalte" >}}). This applies to the currently open base and all apps based on it.

In the [Calendar plugin]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-kalender-plugin" >}}) and on [Calendar pages in apps]{{< relref "help/app-builder/seitentypen-in-universellen-apps/kalenderseiten-in-universellen-apps" >}}), however, you can still configure the first day of the week individually and independently of the setting in the base.
