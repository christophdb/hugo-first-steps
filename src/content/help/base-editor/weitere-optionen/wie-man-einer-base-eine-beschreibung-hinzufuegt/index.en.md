If you want to give "instructions" to other users or record additional information about a base, you can add a description to a base in SeaTable. The description is automatically opened when a user opens the base for the first time.

## Add a description to a base

1. Click the **info icon** directly to the right of a base's name.
2. An input mask opens where you can add a **description** to the base.
3. Your changes will be saved **automatically** when you close the input mask using the **X icon** .
   {{< warning  headline="Tip"  text="You can also **enlarge** the **input mask** by clicking on the **icon** located to the left of the X icon to close the input mask." />}}
