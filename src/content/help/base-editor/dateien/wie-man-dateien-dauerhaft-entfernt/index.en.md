**Files**, **images** and **signatures** that you **delete** in a table can still be found in the Base [file]({{< relref "help/base-editor/dateien/das-dateimanagement-einer-base" >}}) manager. To remove these permanently, you must also delete the files from the file manager.

## Delete files from the file manager

![Remove files and images permanently](images/Delete-files-and-images-permanently.gif)

1. Click on the **three dots** in the Base header and open the **file manager**.
2. Go to the appropriate **folder** where you want to delete the file.
3. Hover the mouse over the **file** you want to delete and click the **trash icon**.
4. Confirm again with **Delete**.

## Final deletion of files

As soon as you have deleted the desired files, they end up in the **recycle bin** of the file manager. They remain there for **60 days** and can be restored. If you want to permanently remove the files from the system before this period has expired, you can **empty** the recycle bin.

1. Click **Recycle Bin** in the navigation.
2. Select either **My F** olders or **System Folders** - depending on where the files you want to permanently delete are located.
3. Click on **Empty**.

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="Please note that **all** files and folders in the recycle bin are **permanently** removed from the system and therefore **cannot** be restored. Therefore, make sure that you **only** delete files from the file manager that are no longer required." />}}
