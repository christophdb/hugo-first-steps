**File management** revolutionizes the way you handle files in your Base. You can upload, rename, copy, move, download and delete **files** there directly. You can even create **new documents** (e.g. Excel, Word or PowerPoint files) and edit them using the integrated editor.

In this overview article you will find all information on the structure and individual functions of the file manager.

## Overview of file management

The file manager contains various folders, which in turn contain various files. A basic distinction can be made between **three folder types**:

- **Custom folders** are independent from the structure of a Base and can be freely created and organized by the user.

![Own folders freely created and organized by the user in the file management system ](images/costum-folders.png)

- **System folders** are automatically created by SeaTable when you create specific columns, apps or web forms. They contain [files]({{< relref "help/base-editor/webformulare/webformulare" >}}).

![System folders created and organized by the SeaTable system in the file management system.](images/system-folders.png)

- A **Seafile folder** contains all the files that you have previously uploaded to the external cloud storage of the same name. How exactly the integration of Seafile libraries works and what advantages it brings, you can learn [here]({{< relref "help/integrationen/integrationen-innerhalb-von-seatable/eine-seafile-bibliothek-an-seatable-anbinden" >}}).

The following diagram shows an overview of the complete **folder structure of the file manager**:

2. Click on the three dots in the Base header to open the **advanced Base options**.
3. Go to **File Management**.

5. A resizable window with the **folder structure** then opens automatically - the Base file management.

![Open file management of a Base](images/opened-file-management.png)

You can also **add** the file manager **to the toolbar** by clicking on the **middle icon** at the top right of the window.

![Adding file management to the toolbar in the Base header](images/add-file-management-to-toolbar.png)

This means you can always access the **file manager** with just one click from your toolbar.

![File management added to the toolbar in the base header](images/file-management-in-toolbar.jpg)

If you want to **remove** the file manager from your toolbar, simply click on the icon at the edge of the window again.

## Adjust window size and position of the file manager

You can adjust the window size of the file manager so that you can keep an eye on your tables and data while managing your files and [drag files from the file manager directly into the appropriate columns of your tables](https://seatable.io/en/?post_type=docs&p=26594#8-toc-title).

To do this, simply open the file manager and move the mouse pointer over the **two lines** at the top of the window until a **double arrow** appears. Then hold down the mouse button and drag the window to the desired position and release as soon as this is reached.

![Adjust the file management window size](images/edit-the-window-size-of-the-file-management.gif)

In addition to adjusting the window size, you also have the option of **pinning** the file manager **to the right-hand side of the page**. To do this, click on the **first icon from the left** at the top right-hand edge.

![Pin the file manager to the right margin of the page](images/pin-file-management-to-side.png)

The file manager then appears in a window on the right-hand side of the page.

![File management pinned to the right side margin ](images/pinned-file-management-to-side.png)

You can pin the file manager to the bottom edge again in the same way.

## The various file management functions in detail

Various management options are available to you within the file management.

### Create a new file in the file manager

You can create and edit new files directly in the file manager with just a few clicks. To do this, first click on **New** and then select either the **New file** option or the various **file types** available for selection.

### Drag and drop files to appropriate table columns

Another useful function of the file manager is the convenient **moving of files**. You can not only **drag and drop** files into the file manager, but also insert them from the file manager into file columns in the table.

{{< warning  headline="Tip"  text="First **reduce** the **size of** the file management window or pin it to the right-hand side of the page to make it easier to drag files into your table columns." />}}

{{< warning  headline="Invalid destination paths"  text="Own folders cannot be moved into **subfolders**, which they themselves are parent to. If the destination paths are invalid, a corresponding **error message** appears." />}}

### Download files

You can **download** all files from the file manager at any time with just a few clicks. Use this function to back up important files on your device.

Hover your mouse over a file and click the **download icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-download" >}}. The selected file will then be automatically saved on your device.

### Delete and restore files

You can **delete** any file from the file manager with just a few clicks. Simply move the mouse over a file and click on the **recycle bin icon**.

Then confirm the process again with **Delete**.

![Confirmation of the deletion process](images/confirm-deletion.jpg)

Files that you delete from the file manager also disappear from your Base (e.g. from signature, file, image columns, web forms or universal apps) and end up in the **recycle bin**, where they remain for 60 days.

{{< warning  headline="Important note"  text="Please note that files in the Recycle Bin are permanently removed from the system **after 60 days**. Consequently, make sure that **only** files that are no longer needed are in the Recycle Bin." />}}

If you want to restore a file from the Recycle Bin, for example because it was accidentally deleted, click **Restore**. You will then find the file in the folder where it was before it was deleted. When you **empty** the Recycle Bin, all deleted files and folders are lost permanently.

![Empty recycle bin or restore files from recycle bin](images/Empty-and-restore-from-trash.png)

### Delete and restore folder

You can delete **your own folders** in the file manager at any time with just a few clicks. To do this, move the mouse over any folder in the **navigation** bar, click on the **three dots** that appear and select **Delete**.

Folders that you delete from the file manager end up in the **recycle bin**, where they remain for 60 days.

{{< warning  headline="Important notes"  text="Please note that when deleting folders, **all files** in the respective folders are also **deleted**. The same applies to the subfolders in a deleted folder. The deleted files will therefore also disappear from your base (e.g. from signature, file, image columns, web forms or universal apps). Make sure that you **only** delete folders with files that are no longer required from the file management. After **60 days** in the recycle bin, both folders and files are permanently removed from the system." />}}

If you want to restore a folder from the Recycle Bin, for example because you accidentally deleted it, click **Restore**. The folder will then appear where it was before you deleted it. When you **empty** the Recycle Bin, all deleted files and folders are lost permanently.
