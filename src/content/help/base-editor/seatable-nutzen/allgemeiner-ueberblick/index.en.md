In SeaTable you organize data of any type and any format, just as you want it: Appointments and tasks for the upcoming product launch, image material for the next exhibition as well as property data for efficient property management. But the use of such a powerful tool as SeaTable needs to be learned.

Therefore, in this chapter you will get a first insight into the possibilities of SeaTable. Specifically, you will learn,

- how to organize data in bases and tables,
- what options you have for data collection,
- How collaboration works in SeaTable,
- how easily you can analyze and statistically evaluate data and
- which diverse display options SeaTable offers.

## Bases and tables

Bases and tables are the central organizational units of SeaTable. Learn the basics of [working with bases and tables](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/einfuehrung-in-die-arbeit-mit-bases-und-tabellen/) and how they are superior to a classic spreadsheet.

## Data acquisition

For authors, nothing is worse than a blank sheet of paper - and in SeaTable, nothing is worse than empty bases and tables. So start right away by creating new columns and rows , entering data manually, copy-and-pasting or importing. Here you will find everything you need for [data entry](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/datenerfassung/).

## Cooperation

As a collaboration platform, SeaTable offers multiple features for efficient [collaboration](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/zusammenarbeit/) - for example, group bases, sharing, and shared data sets, to name a few.

## Statistics and data analysis

Whether simple analyses, mathematical calculations or detailed statistics - SeaTable provides you with all the necessary evaluation tools to get the best out of your data. Join us on an exciting excursion into [statistics and data analysis](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/statistiken/).

## Views and plugins

Unlike a traditional spreadsheet, your tables don't just present themselves as flat grids. Thanks to SeaTable's flexible table views, you'll always have your data in the structure you want. Also, discover the plugins that open up many useful display options. You can use [views and plugins](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seatable-nutzen/ansichten/) to display only a part of the data and present the information as a calendar, gallery, kanban board or chart.
