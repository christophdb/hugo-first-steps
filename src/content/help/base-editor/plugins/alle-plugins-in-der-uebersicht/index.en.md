SeaTable **plugins** give you the opportunity to see your data from a completely different perspective. Visualize appointments, tasks and locations and create laid-out documents and profiles from your data. In the following article, we explain which plugins are available in SeaTable and how you can use them.

![Overview of all plugins in SeaTable](images/Uebersicht-ueber-alle-Plugins-in-SeaTable.gif)

## What is a plugin?

In SeaTable you can create different **views** for your tables, where you can [filter](https://seatable.io/en/docs/ansichtsoptionen/filtern-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht/), [sort](https://seatable.io/en/docs/ansichtsoptionen/sortieren-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht/), [group](https://seatable.io/en/docs/ansichtsoptionen/gruppieren-von-eintraegen-in-einer-ansicht/) and [hide](https://seatable.io/en/docs/ansichtsoptionen/ausblenden-und-verschieben-von-spalten/) data as you wish.

A **plugin** is an optional software component in SeaTable that offers you additional display options. Various plugins can be activated in each base, which display the data of the respective tables and views in **calendars**, **documents** or **galleries**, for example. Read more about [how to activate a plug](https://seatable.io/en/docs/plugins/aktivieren-eines-plugins-in-einer-base/)in in the linked help article.

## Calendar plugin

In the calendar plugin you can display dates from a [date column](https://seatable.io/en/docs/datum-dauer-und-personen/die-datum-spalte/) in a **year**, **month**, **week**, **day** or **agenda view**. You can also use two date columns to display **time spans** and keep track of all important dates, etc.

## Timeline plugin

The timeline plugin represents different periods of time in the form of a **timeline** by a start and end date or by a start date and duration. This way you can keep a good overview of parallel running projects or overlapping appointments. Also for vacation planning in the team and for the occupancy planning of rooms this plugin is excellent.

## Gallery plugin

The gallery plugin is particularly suitable for displaying records with **images**, as it primarily refers to the contents of an [image column](https://seatable.io/en/docs/dateien-und-bilder/die-bild-spalte/). Below the images, the entries of a column are displayed as **titles**. In addition, it is possible to show more columns of the table in this plugin and thus supplement the images with more information from the data sets. Especially for creative and artistic projects this is very helpful to summarize all information at a glance.

## Map plugin

**Locations** can be displayed on a map with the map plugin. You can visualize the entered geographic information with position markers or images. The map plugin can handle **GPS coordinates** as well as **addresses**. However, addresses must be unique in order to be displayed.

## Page design plugin

Using the Page Design plugin, you can layout **documents** such as form letters, business cards, and certificates and populate them with the data in your table. More precisely, you can build layouts with **static elements** that are completed and customized with **dynamic elements** and **table fields**. These offer you the great advantage of inserting all related information (for example, a person's name, address, and job title) into standardized templates, depending on the record, without the need to manually copy data into the documents. In this way, you can create print-ready invoices, certificates or other important documents from the stored data with just a few clicks.
