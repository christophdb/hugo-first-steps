**Plugins** offer you a wide range of possibilities to vividly display the data in your tables. By setting up a plugin in your Base, you can easily switch between the **table view** and, for example, the **calendar or kanban display**.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="You always activate plugins for the entire Base. That means you have to set up a plugin only **once and** then you can use it in **all tables of** your Base." />}}

For quick access to your plugins, you can add them to the **toolbar** next to the view options.

## Activate a plugin

1. Click **Plugins** in the Base header.
2. In the appeared panel go to **Set up plugins**.
3. Set up the desired plugin by clicking **Add.**

You can now already use the plugin. If you still want to add the plugin to your toolbar, proceed like this:

5. Move the mouse cursor over the plugin you have set up and click the **three dots**.
6. Select **Add to Toolbar** from the drop-down menu.
