The **Gallery plugin** is particularly well suited to displaying illustrated records, as it primarily refers to the contents of an [image column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/die-bild-spalte" >}}).

While the images in the **table view** are displayed as thumbnails and can only be enlarged individually by clicking on them, the gallery plugin allows you to get a vivid overview of all records thanks to the larger **preview** images. Thereby the gallery plugin combines all images of a row in one **album**.

## To set up the gallery plugin

In order to use the **Gallery plugin**, you must first [enable]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/aktivieren-eines-plugins-in-einer-base" >}}) it in your Base.

Then, in the settings, specify for which **table view** you want to create a gallery and from which [image column]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/die-bild-spalte" >}}) the images should come. For **Title**, specify the column whose entries you want to use as album title.

## Show and hide information

In the **gallery settings**, which you can reach via the **gear icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}}, you can display more or less information by showing or hiding columns. Activate the **sliders** of the respective columns (e.g. Documents, Status and Date) to have more information from the table displayed in the gallery.

## Multiple images in one row

The **number of images** per album or row is displayed in the gallery with a **number highlighted in gray**. Logically, the number is only displayed when there is more than one image in an album.

Clicking on the preview image opens the album in **full-screen mode**, where you can zoom in and out using the **magnifying glasses** and switch between images using the **arrows**.
