You can insert **headers and footers** as special areas in a page and fill them **with multiple elements**, deciding on the content and arrangement of the elements yourself. With headers and footers, you have the option to insert **page numbers** and lock multiple elements at once.

{{< warning  headline="Applies to all sides"  text="If you use a header or footer, it will be displayed on **all pages of a document**." />}}

## Setting options

You can only vary the **height of** headers and footers, since they always span the **entire width of the page**. In the **Height** field, enter the desired numerical value or change it using the **arrow keys** or scroll with the **mouse wheel**.

Alternatively, you can change the height directly on the page by **right-clicking** on the header or footer and **dragging** the small **square** at the bottom right corner of the frame.

## Header and footer elements

You can insert the following elements in headers and footers:

### Static elements:

- [Static Text](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seitendesign-plugin/statischer-text/)
- [Static image](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seitendesign-plugin/statisches-bild/)

### Dynamic elements:

- [Current date](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seitendesign-plugin/dynamische-elemente/)
- Page number
- [Template name](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seitendesign-plugin/dynamische-elemente/)
- [Current user](https://seatable.io/en/docs/seitendesign-plugin/dynamische-elemente/)

{{< warning  headline="Important info"  text="The **page number** is the only element you can insert **exclusively in headers and footers**. Otherwise, you can use static and dynamic elements in the normal workspace of the page as well." />}}

## Lock and delete

You can **lock** or **delete** headers and footers by selecting the respective option. When you lock a header or footer, **all elements** that you previously inserted in that area are also locked. The same is true for deleting, which causes you to delete all elements in a header or footer as well.
