By creating **multiple calendars** in a base, you can store specific appointments in different calendars. For example, you can create individual calendars for different projects. If you collaborate with multiple people in a base, each team member can create individual calendars.

To create multiple calendars, you need either **multiple tables** or a table with different [views]({{< relref "help/base-editor/ansichten/anlegen-einer-neuen-ansicht" >}}) or a table with different [date columns]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/die-datum-spalte" >}}).

## How to create additional calendars in the calendar plugin

1. Click the **plus icon** to the right of the title of your first calendar.
2. Give the calendar a **name** and confirm with **Submit**.
3. In the {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}} **settings**, specify which table view and date column(s) the new calendar should refer to.
