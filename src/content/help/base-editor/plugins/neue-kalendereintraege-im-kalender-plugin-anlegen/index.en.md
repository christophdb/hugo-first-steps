You have various options for adding **new entries** to the calendar. You can do this **in the underlying table** by creating a new row there and entering an appointment in the [date column](https://seatable.io/en/docs/datum-dauer-und-personen/die-datum-spalte/), which is then also displayed in the calendar plugin.

But it is also very easy to make new entries directly **in the calendar plugin**. There it depends on the selected display**(year**, **month**, **week**, **day** or **agenda**) how you can enter an appointment.

## Create new entries via the row details

### Create new entries via a day field

1. Open the **calendar plugin** and select the **month** or **week** display option.
2. Hover the mouse cursor over a **field** in the calendar and click the **plus icon** that appears in the upper right corner.
3. Create a new entry in the **line details** and confirm by **closing** the window with {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-x" >}}.

### Create new entries by double-clicking

Make a selection in the daily, weekly or monthly overview. **Double click** to a place in the calendar and the **Line details** will also open. Otherwise, create the entry in the same way as described in the instructions above.

### Create new entries using the large plus symbol

At the bottom right-hand edge is a **Large plus symbol in an orange circle**. If you click on it, the **Line details** as well. Otherwise, create the entry in the same way as described in the instructions above.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="This function is available for **all** display options in the calendar." />}}

## Pull up appointments in the weekly and daily overviews

For this function you need **two date columns** that can capture **clock times**.

1. Create a date column for the **start time**, turning on the To the **minute** option.
2. Create a date column for the **end time** and turn on the To the **minute** option.
3. Open the **calendar plugin** and select the **weekly or daily overview**.
4. Set the two date columns for the calendar in the **settings** (accessible via the cogwheel icon {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-set-up" >}}).
5. In the calendar, click on the time you want the appointment to start, hold down the **mouse button** and drag the box open to the time you want the appointment to end.

## Move appointments via drag and drop

You can conveniently **drag and drop** the created dates in the calendar plugin. This will automatically change the corresponding entries in the date columns of your table. This function is available for the **monthly**, **weekly** and **daily overview**.
