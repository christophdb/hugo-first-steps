This article highlights some of the ways you can capture data in SeaTable.

## Manual input

If you have just opened a table, you can simply click with the mouse in a cell and enter data using your keyboard. If necessary, add a [new row]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/hinzufuegen-einer-spalte" >}}) to the table for this purpose.

## Copy-and-Paste

For quick transfer of small amounts of data, you can also use your computer's **clipboard**. To do this, copy the data in an existing table and paste it into SeaTable using [copy-and-paste](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-in-tabellen/hinzufuegen-von-daten-per-copy-and-paste/).

## Data import

SeaTable has a powerful [data import](https://seatable.io/en/docs-category/import-von-daten/) that allows you to capture data from **Excel** and **CSV files** in different ways. If you wonder [which import formats SeaTable supports](https://seatable.io/en/docs/import-von-daten/welche-import-formate-unterstuetzt-seatable/), read the corresponding help articles.

## Forms

[Web forms]({{< relref "help/base-editor/webformulare/webformulare" >}}) are the tool of choice when you want to have new records entered into a spreadsheet **not by yourself**, but by **people inside and outside your team**. Sounds too good to be true? Then try it out right away!

## Entries via automation

Using [automations](https://seatable.io/en/docs/automationen/uebersicht-ueber-automationen/), you no longer have to add entries to your tables manually, but can create them automatically when a previously defined trigger event occurs. You can learn more about this in these articles:
