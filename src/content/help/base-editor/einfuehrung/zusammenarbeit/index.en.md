SeaTable is a powerful tool that lets you organize your data all by yourself. But it is at its best when you work **together with a team**. You already have a strong team? Make it stronger with SeaTable!

In **group bases**, you work collaboratively on the data in real time. If a user makes a change or addition, this is immediately displayed to all other group members. The **history** allows you to trace the development of the current status and - if necessary - to undo individual changes.

If you want to share data with another person or group, you can **share** a base with them in just a few clicks - internally, externally, or via **shared records**.

Last but **not** least, **comments** and **notifications** enable efficient communication in SeaTable.

In the following, you will learn about the collaboration features of SeaTable. You will learn,

- How to work effectively together on bases in a group,
- where you can see changes made by other users,
- what common data sets are,
- how to share data with other users and groups,
- how to share bases with external third parties and
- How to improve team communication with SeaTable.

## Group bases

All members of a group have access to a [group](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/einfuehrung-in-die-arbeit-mit-gruppen/) base. As the group owner, you manage the group and its members. You assign access rights to the [members](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/gruppenmitglieder-und-ihre-berechtigungen/) via different roles - and revoke them just as quickly. You [create](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/eine-neue-gruppe-anlegen/) a [new group](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-gruppen/eine-neue-gruppe-anlegen/) by clicking the **New Group** button under your bases on the start page.

## History

To help you keep track of who made what changes to the data in your Bases and when, the history is temporarily stored in various places in SeaTable. There is an overall **activity log** on the home page, a log for each **base** and a log for each **row**. In addition, you can review **automations** and **scripts** that have been performed, each in an execution log.

## Common data sets

Records that different groups and users in your team need can be made available to them as templates for new tables using [shared records](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/funktionsweise-von-gemeinsamen-datensaetzen/). Any table that your team members create with a shared record, they can [synchronize](https://seatable.io/en/docs/gemeinsame-datensaetze/synchronisation-eines-gemeinsamen-datensatzes/). When they do, SeaTable overwrites the data in the table with that of the current shared record, so everyone is at the same level.

## Internal releases

You want to work temporarily with one or more SeaTable users on one Base? With [internal shares]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/base-und-ansichtsfreigaben-im-ueberblick" >}}) you can do exactly that! You determine whether a share should be read-only or read and write. This way you always keep full control over the data in your Base.

## External releases

Bases can be shared not only with other SeaTable users. You can also make Bases available to third parties via an external share. An [external link]({{< relref "help/startseite/freigaben/externer-link-erklaert" >}}), which you can set with a password and/or an expiration date, gives all persons with knowledge of the link read access to the shared base. You create an external link - like an internal share - via the **share icon** {{< seatable-icon icon="dtable-icon-share" >}} in the base header.

## Comments

To keep discussions where they belong, you can [comment on](https://seatable.io/en/docs/arbeiten-mit-zeilen/zeilen-kommentieren/) each table entry. Group members and others with access to Base are notified of the comments and can respond. This keeps the entire discussion on a topic right in Base. Searching for a discussion in old emails, chat or log is a thing of the past.

## Notifications

Using [notifications](https://seatable.io/en/docs/benachrichtigungen/sinn-und-zweck-von-benachrichtigungen-in-seatable/) within SeaTable, you and your team members are always informed about the most important news and changes in your workspace (e.g. shares and comments).
