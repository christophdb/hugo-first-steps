A **web form** converts your table into a form with open fields. A column in your table corresponds to a field in the associated web form.

The **classic web form** is ideal for online surveys and structured collection of new data, as you can guide users through the completion process.

For access, create a **link** that allows users **without a SeaTable user account** to enter data in the web form.

You can learn more about [web forms]({{< relref "help/base-editor/webformulare/webformulare" >}}) in the linked article.
