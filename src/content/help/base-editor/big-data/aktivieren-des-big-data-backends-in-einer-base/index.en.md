Without activated big data storage, you can record a maximum of 100,000 rows in a base. As soon as you activate it in a base, the previous row limit is removed and you can save unlimited data in a base. You can find out how to activate the big data memory in this article.

## Activate the big data storage in a base

2. In the Base header, click the **three dots** in the upper right corner.
3. Select the **Big Data Management** option.
4. Click **Activate Big Data Function**.

## Designation as archive/backend

The big data store used to also be called the _big data backend_ or _archive_. These terms may still sometimes appear in the forum or in the help section, but they always refer to the big data **store**.
