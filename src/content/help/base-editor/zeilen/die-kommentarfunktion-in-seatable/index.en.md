When you work on data together with other users, discussions, comments, or questions about the data (e.g., about the correctness of entries) are bound to occur. You don't want to have such **conversations** by e-mail or in chat systems, but preferably directly where the data is, namely in the corresponding **row** table. This way, even days and weeks later, it is clear without a long search why the data is what it is, how it was agreed upon, and what the current status is.

SeaTable provides a **comment function for** the exchange with other users, which we present in this post.

## Comment function

In SeaTable you can have a separate discussion in each **row** of the table to have a separate discussion. rows The tables in which a discussion is in progress are marked by a **balloon icon** in the first column. The number on the bubble indicates the number of new comments in the last 7 days. You can view the ongoing discussion by clicking on the icon.

The discussions and comments are visible to all people with access to the table. This includes people who access a table via an [external link](https://seatable.io/en/docs/freigaben/externen-link-fuer-eine-ansicht-erstellen/).

Comments in a table are not taken into account when [exporting a Base]({{< relref "startseite/import-von-daten/datenimport-und-export" >}}) nor when [exporting a table to an XLSX file](/en/docs/handbuch/datenmanagement/datenimport-und-export/#tabelle-exportieren) and are then lost.
