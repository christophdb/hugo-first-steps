SeaTable stores all changes that are made in a Base. Within a row the **rows-Log offers the possibility to track exactly when which user has made which change.**

## The rows-Log

1. Move the mouse to the **numbering field of** a row and click the **double arrow icon**.
2. In the opened **row details** window, click the square **door icon** in the upper right corner.
3. The window expands. Click **Logs** to the right of the comments.

In the rows-Log you will find in antichronological order the most recent changes made in the row . Each log entry contains the following information:

- Name of the processor
- Date of the change
- Affected column
- Description of the change

## Showing and hiding the comments and logs of a row

By default, the **comments** and **logs** are hidden when you open the **row details**. By clicking the small **door icon** you can expand this area and display the information.

## Differences between rows- and base log

The **rows log only gives you an overview of the changes in a specific** row. If you want to view all changes in a base instead, the [base log]({{< relref "help/base-editor/historie-und-versionen/aenderungen-ueber-die-logs-rueckgaengig-machen" >}}) will help you.
