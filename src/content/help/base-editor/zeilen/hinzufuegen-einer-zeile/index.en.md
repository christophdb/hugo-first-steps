There are several ways to add a **new row** in SeaTable. You will learn about the different possibilities in this article.

## Ways to create a new row

The first option is to click on the **plus icon** in the **numbering column** in the lower left corner of your table. This will create a new empty row at the bottom of the table.

The second way to insert a new row is to **right-click** on a row and select the option **Insertrow above/below** from the menu. In the small input field you can specify the number of rows added.

To quickly **several new rows** you can also use the key combination {{< key "Shift" >}} + {{< key "Enter" >}} use. First click on a **row**, under which you want to insert new rows . Then hold down the **Shift key** button and press the **Enter key**to quickly add blank rows .

Furthermore, some **plugins** of SeaTable offer the option to add new entries. These include the [gallery]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/neue-kalendereintraege-im-kalender-plugin-anlegen" >}}) and the [Kanban plugin]({{< relref "help/base-editor/plugins/anleitung-zum-kanban-plugin" >}}).

## Why you cannot create new rows

You can't add a new row in a table and you don't see a plus icon? Then you probably do not have the appropriate **permissions** in base or View.

For example, you may have been granted read-only rights instead of **read-and-write** rights in a **share**. If you do not have the necessary rights, contact the sharing user or an **administrator** on your team.
