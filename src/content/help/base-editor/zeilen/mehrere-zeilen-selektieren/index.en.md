It surely happens that you want to [copy]({{< relref "help/base-editor/zeilen/sperren-einer-zeile" >}}) **several rows** at the same time. To perform these actions, you must **select** the desired rows beforehand.

SeaTable offers **three** different ways to select multiple rows and then perform the desired action. This article is only about **selecting** the desired rows. You can learn more about the **actions** in the articles linked above.

## Option 1: Select all desired rows one after the other

The most obvious option to select multiple rows is to simply check each of the desired rows **individually**. To do this, hover the mouse pointer over the **numbering column** and place check marks in the **boxes** at the beginning of the rows. You should choose this option if you want to select only a few scattered rows.

## Option 2: Define start and end of line selection

Instead of marking row for row, you can also use a **contiguous section** to select between two rows. To do this, first place a check mark next to the one row and then press and hold the {{< key "Shift" >}} key at another row. SeaTable then marks all rows between the selected start and end.

## Option 3: Select all rows at once

The last option is to check the **selection box** in the table header above the numbering column, which will select **all rows of your table** with one click. If you now want to remove **single rows** from the selection again, you can **uncheck** them.

## Cancel current row selection

As soon as you click on a cell in the table, the row selection made so far is cancelled.
