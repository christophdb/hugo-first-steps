Each row of a Base has a unique **URL**. You can copy this if you want to reference the exact record in a specific row , for example to forward the data to a team member. However, the URL can only be opened by people who are logged into SeaTable and have access to the row .

In addition, you can read out the [rows ID from the URL, which you need for]({{< relref "help/skripte/allgemein/unterschied-zwischen-javascript-und-python-scripten-in-seatable" >}}), for example.

### There are two different ways to copy a rows URL:

- Copy the rows URL via the context menu
- Copying the rows URL via the row details
