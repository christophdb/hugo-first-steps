## Add team members to the chat

You can draw the attention of team members to your comment by sending it to them via the **Plus symbol** to add to the chat. Alternatively, you can also add a {{< key "@" >}} and the **Member name** to add team members to the chat. The member gets a **Notification in SeaTable** and will be notified about new comments in the chat history, even if no further mention about {{< key "@" >}} takes place.

## Display of the commented rows

In the first column of the table, a **speech bubble icon** appears for commented rows with a number indicating the **number of comments** in the last 180 days. Click on the icon to open the comment window with the chat history.

{{< warning  headline="Note"  text="If no one writes a new comment on a row for **180 days**, the **speech bubble icon** **disappears** again. The comments are retained and can still be accessed via the **row details**, but it is no longer visible in the table that this row was previously commented on." />}}

## Delete comments and mark as done

Only the **creator** himself can **delete** his comments or **mark them as done.** To do this, he clicks on the **three dots** to the right of his comment and selects the desired option. Comments marked as done are indicated by a green color.
