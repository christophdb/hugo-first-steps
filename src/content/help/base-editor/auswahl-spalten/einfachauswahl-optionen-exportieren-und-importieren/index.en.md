The options you have available in single or multiple selection columns can not only be **entered manually**, but can also be conveniently **exported** from an existing column and **imported into** another column. This saves you a lot of work if you want to use the same options over and over again - even across different bases - for your **single** and **multiple selection columns**.

## Export options from a selection column

1. Click the **triangle icon to** the right of the name of any single or multiple selection column.
2. Select **Edit single selection** or **Edit multiple selection**.
3. Click **Export Options**.

The options are now saved as a JSON file **exports**. Depending on the browser settings, the download was directly on your device **Saved at** or you still need to specify a location. In the next step you can put the options into any single or multiple selection column **import**.
