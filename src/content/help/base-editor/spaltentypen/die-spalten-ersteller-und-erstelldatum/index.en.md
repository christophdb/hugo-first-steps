The columns **Creator** and **Created time** are filled **automatically** by SeaTable and therefore represent special column types. While SeaTable fills the Creator column with the **name of the user** who created the row, the Created time column records the **moment** (creation date and time) when the user created the row.

## Special features of the two column types

- The automatically entered values in the Creator and Created time columns **cannot** be edited.
- When creating the two column types, **no** options are available, except for the column name.
- Only **one** Creator and Created time column can be created per table. If you try to add another column of the same type, the message "Another column has this column type." appears.

- For this reason, you cannot **duplicate** Creator and Created columns **and customize their column type**.
