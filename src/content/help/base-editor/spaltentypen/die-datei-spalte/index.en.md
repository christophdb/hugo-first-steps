## Adding existing files

Besides new files that you upload locally to the cell of a file column, you can also add existing files, which can come from **three sources**:

- **Last uploaded**: Here you will find the most recently uploaded files saved in the base [file manager]({{< relref "help/base-editor/dateien/das-dateimanagement-einer-base" >}}).
- **My folders**: Here you have access to files in your own folders, which you can create and fill in the [file manager]({{< relref "help/base-editor/dateien/das-dateimanagement-einer-base" >}}).
- **Seafile**: Here you can select files from [Seafile libraries]({{< relref "help/integrationen/integrationen-innerhalb-von-seatable/eine-seafile-bibliothek-an-seatable-anbinden" >}}) that are attached to your base.
