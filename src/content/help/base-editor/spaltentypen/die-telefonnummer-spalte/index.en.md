There is a separate column type in SeaTable for entering **phone numbers**. Compared to a normal text column, the phone number column offers the advantage that you can **call a phone number** with a mouse click.

## Create a phone number column

1. Click on the **Plus symbol** to the right of the last column in the table header.
2. Give the column a **name**.
3. Select the **column type Phone number**.
4. Confirm with **Submit**.

### Set default value

You can define a preset [default value]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spalten/standardwert-fuer-eine-spalte-festlegen" >}}) for each phone number column. This is automatically entered in each new row of the table.

### Validate input

As with text columns, you have the option of validating entries in the telephone number column. By performing a **format check**, you can highlight telephone numbers that deviate from the valid format. You can also use [regular expressions]({{< relref "help/base-editor/spaltentypen/validierung-der-eingabe-bei-textfeldern" >}}) for validation.

## Start calls

The phone number column type makes your daily communication even easier. A click on the **phone icon in a cell** transfers the phone number to your telephony application. On cell phones, this works without any further configuration. The same applies on the desktop if a shortcut to telephony software has been set up in the browser.
