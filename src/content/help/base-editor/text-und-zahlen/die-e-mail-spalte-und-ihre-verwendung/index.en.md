The e-mail column is a column type that allows you to enter e-mail addresses. Unlike a text column, the email column ensures that the input has the structure of a valid email address.

In addition, a small envelope is displayed as soon as you select a cell in the e-mail column. Clicking on this icon opens your e-mail program so that you can directly write an e-mail to the selected address.

## Using the email column

1. Create a new column with the column type **E-mail** via the **plus symbol**.
2. Enter a **valid e-mail address** in a cell of the column.
3. Click the cell that contains the email address and an **envelope** will appear.
4. Click the icon to open a **new email** in your default email program.
