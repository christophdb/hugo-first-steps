**URL columns** interpret the entered information as a resource on the Internet or local network and allow you to call **links** directly with a click. SeaTable automatically adds http(s):// as a prefix to the URL if you have not entered it.

## How to use the URL column

1. Create a column with the column type **URL** via the **plus symbol**.
2. Paste a **URL** into a cell of the column. As soon as you select the **cell** again, a link icon appears.
3. Click on the **link icon** to open a new window with the desired web page.
