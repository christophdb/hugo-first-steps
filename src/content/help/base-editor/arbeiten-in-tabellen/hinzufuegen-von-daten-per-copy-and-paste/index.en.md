SeaTable knows the popular keyboard shortcuts {{< keyboard "Ctrl" >}}+{{< keyboard "C" >}} and {{< keyboard "Ctrl" >}}+{{< keyboard "V" >}} for copying and pasting data. This works both with data you want to copy within SeaTable and with data you want to paste into SeaTable.

## Copy and paste data

In a text editor or spreadsheet, select the values that you want to copy into SeaTable. Copy the values with {{< keyboard "Ctrl" >}}+{{< keyboard "C" >}} and switch to a SeaTable table. Select a cell there and insert the values with {{< keyboard "Ctrl" >}}+{{< keyboard "V" >}} one.

It should be noted that copy-and-paste will _not_ work if the **formats of** the copied data do not match those of the column type of the cells to be pasted.

SeaTable even supports you to the point of adding additional columns when needed.

## Duplicate a row or column

Sometimes it's faster to duplicate an entire row or column. Here you can learn how to do that:

- [Duplicate a column](https://seatable.io/en/docs/spalten/duplizieren-einer-spalte/)

## Professional tip

To **select** an **entire column**, click on the **empty area** next to the name of the respective column in the table header. This way, the entire column is selected with one click.
