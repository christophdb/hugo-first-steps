Tables in SeaTable can contain thousands of records. So that you can still find individual cells or values quickly and easily, SeaTable provides the option to search for individual values and terms.

## How to find what you are looking for in a table

![Find a cell or value in a table](https://seatable.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Finding-a-cell-or-value-in-a-table-in-SeTable.gif)

1. In a Base, open any **table** where you are looking for a specific value or cell.
2. Click on the **magnifying glass** at the top right under the Base options.
3. Enter a **value** or a **term in** the search field.
4. The corresponding **search results** are automatically displayed and highlighted.
5. You can switch between the search results using the **triangle icons** in the search box.

## Two professional tips

SeaTable's search offers two more functions that we don't want to deprive you of, of course:

- If you click on **Search all tables** below the search field after clicking on the magnifying glass, a window opens in which you can search **all** **tables** belonging to the Base for your entered term or value.
- Of course SeaTable also supports the key combination {{< keyboard "CTRL" >}} + {{< keyboard "F" >}}to activate the search field.
