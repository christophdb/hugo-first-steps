You can perform various **operations** using the data processing function. You can perform mathematical calculations across all values in a column, as well as correlate values when entries in two different tables are identical.

You can **edit** already created data processing operations at any time using the view options in your tables:

2. Click on the **three dots** in the view options.
3. Click on **Data Processing**.
4. Hover the mouse over an applied data processing operation and click the **pencil icon**.
