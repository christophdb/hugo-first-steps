There are always questions about the SeaTable Cloud license model and the costs for individual users. This article is intended to clarify the matter and answer all your questions.

{{< warning  headline="Important"  text="This article does not apply to the SeaTable Server and SeaTable Dedicated products." />}}

## Is SeaTable Free really free?

SeaTable Free is completely free of charge. You do not need to provide a credit card or any other payment information when registering your team in the SeaTable Cloud. With Free, you can invite up to 25 team members to your team free of charge or create them yourself as a team administrator. You only need to purchase a license if you want to switch to a Plus or Enterprise subscription.

## Who or what needs to be licensed?

Basically, you need a license for each active team member with their own login. This is a collective license for your team, i.e. you specify the maximum number of members your team should have. The license is not tied to individual persons. If a team member is deactivated, you can simply create a new team member without this affecting your license.

## Can a team have multiple subscriptions? Can team members have different subscriptions?

All team members have the same subscription within SeaTable Cloud. It is therefore not possible to book an upgrade to Plus or Enterprise for only part of your team. If you want to book the features and higher limits of Plus or Enterprise, you must do so for all members of your team.

## How are the costs for Plus or Enterprise calculated?

The calculation is very simple and is based on the following three components:

- Desired maximum team size (=persons)
- Plus or Enterprise subscription
- Monthly or annual billing

For example, if you want to take out a monthly Plus subscription for 4 people, you pay 4 (people) x 9 (price) € per month.

If you pay annually, you pay 4 (persons) x 7 (price) x 12 (months) € for one year.
